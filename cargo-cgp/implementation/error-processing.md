# Error processing

`cargo-cgp` turns a compiler's raw diagnostics into readable, root-cause-first CGP errors, and the
string-level logic that does the turning lives in one rustc-free crate,
[`cargo-cgp-error-processing`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/tree/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing).
This document records what that crate holds, why it is kept apart from the driver, how the driver
drives it, and how it is tested.

The crate is **driven entirely by the driver**; the front-end no longer touches diagnostics. It
exists as a separate crate for one reason: it links no compiler internals, so it builds and its
tests run on any toolchain, without the driver's `rustc_private` linkage. The driver depends on it
and calls into it from its emitter; the crate never depends on the driver or the front-end. Keeping
the logic here is what lets a plain unit test exercise a transform over a hand-built string, with no
compiler, no cargo, and no `cargo-cgp` process in the loop.

## What the crate holds

The crate has six tenants, all driven by the driver's emitter. Grouping them here, apart from the
driver, is what keeps them unit-testable.

- **Post-processing** ([`postprocess`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/tree/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/postprocess)) is
  the set of fallback text transforms the driver applies to a diagnostic's messages so raw CGP
  constructs do not look confusing. Each is a pure `&str -> Option<String>` — `Some` when it changed
  the text — and
  [`postprocess_message`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/postprocess/chain.rs) chains
  them.
- **The wiring rewrite** ([`rewrite`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/tree/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/rewrite)) is the
  string transform that renames CGP wiring messages, over the
  [`ComponentNameMap`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/rewrite/names.rs) the driver fills
  in from the compiler. It also rewrites the `E0275` wiring-overflow header into its `[CGP-E010]`
  form. It is documented where it is used, in
  [The driver](driver.md#naming-the-traits-behind-a-component-marker).
- **The diagnosis model and its wording**
  ([`diagnosis`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/tree/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/diagnosis)) is the rustc-free root-cause
  model — the `Resolved` failure the driver's typed resolver produces, in owned `String` form — and
  the wording that turns it into diagnostic text. Two pure cause-list transforms run ahead of the
  wording: `Causes::union` folds duplicate copies of one leaf into a single cause holding
  every path (what the emitter's coalesced block needs, since its members were grouped for sharing a
  cause), and `coalesce_underived_fields` then merges the *distinct* underived fields of one struct
  into the single derive fix they share. `plan_resolved` runs the latter and composes the rewritten header, the
  fix `help`s, and the `root cause:` note into a `DiagnosisPlan`, which the emitter only maps onto
  rustc's `DiagInner`. The note travels as an unrendered `PendingNote` — the causes and the
  header-stated leaf — because rendering it needs the emission order only the emitter's flush knows;
  keeping one representation rather than a rendered string alongside is what stops the tests pinning
  one note while the emitter shows another. keeping every piece rustc-free is what makes the whole
  diagnosis-to-text layer unit-testable without a `TyCtxt`. The same module holds the structured
  dependency-graph nodes and their rendering (`node.rs`) and the graph that merges and renders them
  (`graph.rs`), so every node template and the whole merge/render live here. It is documented in
  [Typed root-cause resolution](typed-root-cause-resolution.md) and
  [Dependency-graph rendering](dependency-graph-rendering.md). The module also holds the
  duplicate-key conflict wording (`wiring.rs`): the `WiringConflict` model and `plan_wiring_conflict`,
  which words the `[CGP-E004]`–`[CGP-E008]` headers (one per conflict shape) the driver's `resolve::conflict` classifier feeds it (see
  [The driver](driver.md#reshaping-a-duplicate-key-conflict)).
- **The dependency-tree renderer**
  ([`tree`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/tree.rs)) is the `DependencyTree` type and its
  `cargo tree`-style renderer over the tiny `termtree` crate — the render target the
  [dependency graph](dependency-graph-rendering.md) expands into. The graph itself (in `diagnosis`)
  does the merging: the driver's resolver hands over one path of structured nodes per way a cause is
  reached, and the graph fuses the nodes several paths share into a DAG with `(*)`-marked shared
  subtrees. It is documented in
  [Typed root-cause resolution](typed-root-cause-resolution.md) and
  [Dependency-graph rendering](dependency-graph-rendering.md).
- **The de-duplication ledger** ([`dedup`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/dedup.rs)) is
  the `DedupLedger` the emitter records each transformed diagnostic in, so the re-reports one
  lazy-wiring mistake produces at many sites are suppressed. The key scheme — the recovered cause,
  the rendered text, and the coded header — lives with the ledger, documented in
  [The driver](driver.md#naming-the-traits-behind-a-component-marker).
- **The signature keys** ([`signature`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/diagnosis/wording/signature.rs))
  are the two span-independent keys the emitter groups failures on: `cause_signature` (context,
  failing consumer trait(s), and each root-cause leaf) identifies *the same* failure across its
  re-reports for de-duplication. It is deliberately *textual*, because the ledger compares it against
  the rendered-message keys it falls back to for a declined diagnostic. The emitter's coalescing groups
  on a *structural* key instead, through `group_by_shared_cause`
  ([`group`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/diagnosis/group.rs)), which partitions the
  coalescible failures into the connected components of the shares-a-cause relation — keyed on each
  cause's context and `Leaf` rather than on the lead that leaf words, so grouping does not shift when a
  lead is reworded, and per cause rather than per whole failure, because one mistake surfaces at several
  depths and each depth reaches a different *subset* of its causes, so demanding two identical sets
  grouped none of them. Both are pure functions over the `Resolved` model.
- **The text signals** ([`signals`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/signals.rs)) are the
  stable rustc phrasings the emitter's candidate checks key on — the wiring-trait mention that makes
  a diagnostic a resolution candidate, the method-bounds `E0599` shape the resolver may safely run
  on, the method-probe advice the emitter strips, the orphan-parameter `E0210` shape, the
  `?`-operator cascade wording, and the trailing "detailed explanations" footer the emitter rebuilds
  (both recognizing the line and reading the codes it names) — each a pure function, so the wording
  dependence on rustc's phrasing is documented and tested in one place.

A further module,
[`code`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/code.rs),
holds the `CGP-E` error-code constants the rewrite and the diagnosis wording stamp on classified
main messages (catalogued in [error-code.md](../error-code.md)). This document covers the
post-processing transforms in full and points at the other tenants' own documents.

## Where post-processing sits in the pipeline

Post-processing is the driver's final diagnostic pass, and it runs on **every** diagnostic the
driver emits, after whatever transform came before it (see [The error pipeline](error-pipeline.md)).
The driver's emitter first tries the [typed root-cause resolver](typed-root-cause-resolution.md); if
that declines, it renames the CGP wiring messages it recognizes; then, either way, the diagnostic
passes through the post-processing transforms.

The pass does two jobs depending on what came before it, and both keep raw CGP spellings out of the
output. For a diagnostic the tool left **un-rewritten**, post-processing is the whole cleanup — it
strips the `cgp::` prefixes, resugars the `Symbol!` and `Path!` lists, and rewords an unmet
`HasField` bound, so a diagnostic the tool does not classify still reads cleanly. For a **rewritten**
one, only the prefix strip and the `Symbol!`/`Path!` resugaring bite: they tidy the compiler-formatted
CGP type names a rewrite embeds — a provider like `RedirectLookup<…, PathCons<Symbol<…>>>` in a coded
header, folded to `RedirectLookup<…, Path!(@…)>`, say — while the missing-field reword finds nothing
to match, because the resolver's tree never carries the `` `HasField<…>` is not implemented `` clause
the reword keys on.

## How the driver applies the transforms

The driver applies post-processing over a `DiagInner` before its inner emitter renders it, so the
rendered output reflects the change. Each transform is a text function, and the driver runs
[`postprocess_message`] over every plain-string message and span label of the diagnostic and its
children — the same reach the compiler's renderer has, so the caret label, the notes, and the header
are all covered. Editing the structured `DiagInner` rather than a rendered blob means the transform
never touches the source snippets the emitter pulls from the `SourceMap`, so it cannot corrupt a line
of the user's own code the way a whole-text rewrite could.

**One rustc "message" can be several styled fragments, and a construct split across them needs the
fragments read together.** `Diag::highlighted_*` stores one entry per `StringPart`, which the
renderer concatenates; rustc splits a message that way to highlight part of it, and when what it
highlights is the *difference between two types* it splits at every difference. Its "similar impl"
hint does exactly that, so a `Symbol<3, Chars<'B', …>>` in one of the two traits is shredded into a
fragment per character and no fragment holds a whole construct to match — the header beside it would
read `Symbol!("Bar")` while the hint still showed the raw list. So the driver post-processes each
fragment first, keeping rustc's highlighting, and then reads them as the one line they render as
through
[`postprocess_fragments`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/postprocess/chain.rs).
When that recovers something the per-fragment pass could not, the message collapses to that single
unstyled string. Matching on the concatenation is matching on what the reader actually sees, and the
highlighting is given up only when there was a construct to recover — never merely because a
fragment was tidied on its own.

One transform needs a fact about the whole diagnostic rather than one message, and the driver
computes it once up front. The missing-field reword must know whether the context implements
`HasField` for *any* field, because that decides between two wordings whose fixes differ, and the
"similar impl" landmark that tells it can sit in a different child than the clause. So the driver
scans every message and label with
[`context_has_hasfield_impls`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/postprocess/missing_field.rs)
first, then passes the answer into each per-message rewrite.

## The post-processing transforms

Post-processing is a chain of transforms applied in order, so the output of one feeds the next, and
the order matters. Module-path stripping runs first so the later transforms match the bare names
(`Symbol`, `Chars`, …) rather than their fully-qualified forms; `Symbol!` resugaring runs before
`Path!` resugaring (which reads the already-resugared `Symbol!("…")` segments), before list resugaring
(which reads a `Field`'s `Symbol!("…")` tag when naming a struct field or enum variant), and before
the field rewrite (which matches the resugared `HasField<Symbol!("…")>` form). Six transforms run
today, in three groups:

- **The two path strips** —
  [`strip_module_paths`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/postprocess/strip_modules.rs),
  which collapses every `a::b::C` identifier run to its final segment (`contexts::app::MockApp` →
  `MockApp`, `f64: std::cmp::Eq` → `f64: Eq`), and
  [`strip_cgp_prefixes`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/postprocess/strip_prefixes.rs),
  which removes the CGP re-export paths in `CGP_PREFIXES` (`cgp::prelude::Chars` → `Chars`) and is
  largely redundant now that the general strip runs first. They lead the chain because everything after
  them matches bare type names; [Resugaring](resugaring.md#the-path-strips-that-run-first) covers what
  each leaves alone and why.
- **The three resugaring transforms** —
  [`resugar_symbol`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/postprocess/resugar_symbol.rs)
  (`Symbol<2, Chars<'x', Chars<'y', Nil>>>` → `Symbol!("xy")`),
  [`resugar_path`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/postprocess/resugar_path.rs)
  (`PathCons<Symbol!("app"), PathCons<GreeterComponent, Nil>>` → `@app.GreeterComponent`, or the
  `Path!(@…)` macro form when its `wrap` parameter is set), and
  [`resugar_lists`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/postprocess/resugar_list.rs)
  (`Cons`/`Either` lists → `Product![…]`/`Sum![…]`, or `Struct! { … }`/`Enum! { … }` when every
  element is a named field) — reverse a CGP type-level expansion back to the syntax the programmer
  wrote. They are one of the tool's [three resugaring implementations](resugaring.md), which
  **[Resugaring](resugaring.md)** documents in full: what each construct expands to and folds back to,
  the exact-match rule that makes each decline rather than guess, why this text implementation needs
  hand-rolled structural parsing where the driver's typed one does not, and who passes `wrap`. Read it
  before changing any of the three, since a change to what a construct resugars to belongs in all three
  implementations at once.
- **[`rewrite_missing_fields`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/postprocess/missing_field.rs)**
  turns an unmet `HasField` bound into a field-oriented message. It matches (after the two transforms
  above) `` the trait `HasField<Symbol!("name")>` is not implemented for `Context` `` and distinguishes
  two cases whose fixes differ. When the context implements `HasField` for some other field, it is a
  single missing field (`` missing field `name` on `Context` ``); when it implements `HasField` for no
  field at all, the whole derive is missing
  (`` `#[derive(HasField)]` is required to access field `name` on `Context` ``). Neither rewrite
  carries a CGP error code: the clause it rewrites sits in a sub-message, and codes classify only a
  rewritten *main* message (see [error-code.md](../error-code.md)). The tell that separates the two
  cases is rustc's "similar impl" landmark, which the CGP
  [check-trait-failure catalog entry](../../cgp/errors/checks/check-trait-failure.md) documents:
  its presence — either inline (`but trait `HasField<…>` is implemented for it`, one other field) or as
  a separate `` `Context` implements trait `HasField<…>` `` note (several other fields) — means a single
  missing field; its absence means the missing derive.

  **The empty-derived-struct case is fine, not a defect.** The single-vs-derive classification is
  exact except for one degenerate input, and that input needs no fix. A context that derives
  `HasField` but declares **no fields at all** gets the missing-derive message even though the derive
  is present — but that is correct, because `#[derive(HasField)]` emits one impl per field, so on a
  fieldless struct it emits *nothing*, identical to no derive at all. A fieldless derive leaves no
  trace in the generated program, so it is genuinely impossible to tell whether it was written; the
  two are the same program wherever `HasField` is concerned.

In practice the missing-field reword rarely fires today, because the [typed root-cause
resolver](typed-root-cause-resolution.md) recovers most missing-field failures from the compiler and
replaces them with a dependency tree before this fallback is reached. The transform remains for the
diagnostics the resolver declines, where the text clause is all there is to work with.

## Testing with pure inputs

Because each transform is a pure function over a string, it is tested without running the tool. A
test drives one transform over the case under test and asserts on the returned `Option<String>`;
nothing compiles, no driver runs, and the test is fast and deterministic, so a whole catalog of
cases can be exercised as ordinary library tests. This is what the rustc-free design buys.
[`tests/postprocess.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/postprocess.rs)
drives each transform — a stripped prefix, an exactly-matched `Symbol!`, a wrong length or foreign
type left alone, the single-field (inline and separate-note landmark) versus missing-derive
branches, and the `postprocess_message` chain end to end. The diagnosis wording is tested the same
way, only over a hand-built `Resolved` rather than a string:
[`tests/diagnosis.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/diagnosis.rs)
drives `plan_resolved` through the missing-field, missing-derive, `Deref`-target,
field-type-mismatch, use-site, kept-ordinary-bound, and provider-header cases, asserting the header,
`help`s, and notes it returns with no compiler in the loop.

The [UI snapshot suite](testing.md) exercises the transforms a second way, over real diagnostics:
every fixture's `.cgp.stderr` is what the driver rendered after applying them, so a change to a
transform that affects an emitted diagnostic shows up as a snapshot diff. The two levels guard
different seams — this crate's tests pin a transform on a curated input, while the UI suite proves
the transforms stay consistent with what the driver emits across the whole catalog.

## Planned work

The transforms still ahead extend the per-diagnostic cleanup, each a new function added to the
post-processing chain, each applying the same exact-match caution `resugar_symbol` sets the precedent
for. The type-level encodings a CGP diagnostic carries are now all decoded — `Symbol!`, `Path!`, and
the `Product!`/`Sum!` lists with their record and variant forms — so what remains on that front is
whichever encoding a new CGP construct introduces, and the place to add it is
[Resugaring](resugaring.md). Recognizing more error classes is the other direction, each rewriting its
message the way the missing-field transform does.

One larger transformation is deliberately out of scope for this crate: collapsing a *cascade* — the
one deep mistake reported at every transitively dependent provider — into a single root cause. That
is a cross-diagnostic transform, and it can only be decided by looking at the whole diagnostic set,
which this crate's per-string transforms never see. It would have to live in the driver's emitter,
which would need to buffer the compilation's diagnostics before emitting them; it does not exist yet.

## Comparison with Clippy

Clippy offers no prior art for this crate, and the absence is itself informative. Clippy defines no
diagnostic type of its own and never rewrites a diagnostic: it reuses rustc's `Diag`/`DiagCtxt`
machinery and emits its lints through the compiler's own emitters, so its output is rustc's,
unmodified
([`clippy_utils/src/diagnostics.rs`](../../../external/rust-clippy/clippy_utils/src/diagnostics.rs)).
`cargo-cgp` does the opposite — it *rewrites* the diagnostics rustc already produced — which is why
it needs a body of string transforms Clippy has no equivalent of. Keeping those transforms in a
rustc-free crate is the design that makes them testable without the compiler, precisely because
Clippy's "just use the compiler's emitter" approach is not open to a tool that rewrites.

## Tests

- [`crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/postprocess.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/postprocess.rs) —
  drives each post-processing transform over crafted inputs: the stripped/left-alone prefix cases, the
  exact-match cases `resugar_symbol` must skip, the `PathCons` → `Path!` resugaring (symbol, type, and
  primitive segments, the open `_` tail folded to a `.*` wildcard, and the non-round-trippable cases
  `resugar_path` must skip), the single-field (inline and separate-note landmark) versus missing-derive
  branches of `rewrite_missing_fields`, and the `postprocess_message` chain.
- [`crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/rewrite.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/rewrite.rs) —
  the wiring-message rewrite over a hand-built name map (see [The driver](driver.md#tests)).
- [`crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/diagnosis.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/diagnosis.rs) —
  `plan_resolved` and the wording over hand-built `Resolved` values: the missing-field, missing-derive,
  and `Deref`-target field cases, a field-type mismatch, an abstract-type mismatch (with its wiring
  `help`) and its help-less plain-associated-type sibling, a use-site method failure, a kept ordinary
  bound (header dropped, lead-less note), a provider header via the text rewrite, and the pluralized
  consumer header.
- [`crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/tree.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/tree.rs) —
  the `termtree`-backed `render_dependency_tree` (a list, a branch); building and merging trees is
  the graph's job, tested in `graph.rs`.
- [`crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/graph.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/graph.rs) —
  the `DependencyGraph` build-and-render, as `insta` inline snapshots: a list, a shared-prefix
  branch, a subsuming cascade, converging leaves, a diamond, a super-root, a within-path repeat, and
  the generic elision (see
  [Dependency-graph rendering](dependency-graph-rendering.md)).
- [`crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/wiring.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/wiring.rs) —
  `plan_wiring_conflict` and `wiring_conflict_help` over hand-built `WiringConflict` values: the
  duplicate, overlap (component and path forms), multiple-namespaces, redirect (header plus its help),
  and same-/different-path duplicate-redirect headers.
- [`crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/coalesce.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/coalesce.rs) —
  `coalesce_underived_fields` over hand-built causes: the merged group (keeping every field's path),
  its lead and single derive help, and the boundaries (a lone underived field, genuinely missing
  fields, different owners, a group beside a missing field).
- [`crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/group.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/group.rs) —
  `group_by_shared_cause` over hand-built resolutions: failures sharing a cause grouped, disjoint ones
  kept apart, the union-of-two-others case partial overlap produces, the transitive bridge that makes
  the relation a partition, the context keeping one field name on two contexts apart, a causeless
  failure alone, and the arrival ordering of the groups and their members.
- [`crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/causes.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/causes.rs) —
  the `Causes` set: one leaf reached by three consumers collecting into one cause with all three paths,
  the repeated-underived-field lead the invariant prevents, distinct leaves kept apart, an exact repeat
  of a path dropped, `from_sub_chains` grouping, `union` folding a shared cause while keeping every
  route (and its associativity), and `headed_by` prefixing every path — plus its commutation with the
  grouping, which is why heading needs no re-merge.
- [`crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/dedup.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/dedup.rs) —
  the `DedupLedger` key scheme: a re-reported cause suppressed, distinct causes kept, the text key,
  the coded-header key collapsing a declined fallback, and a kept rustc header never keying.
- [`crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/signals.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/tests/signals.rs) —
  the text signals: the wording each matches and the near-miss it must not (the two `E0599` shapes,
  the method-probe artifacts, the orphan marker-plus-phrase pair, the `?`-cascade phrasing, and both
  footer forms — including the reworded line that yields no codes, the case the rebuild must decline
  on rather than delete the footer).
- The [UI snapshot suite](testing.md) exercises the transforms over every fixture's real diagnostics:
  each `.cgp.stderr` is what the driver rendered after applying them.

- [`crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/tree.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/tree.rs) —
  the `DependencyTree` type and its `cargo tree`-style renderer, the target the
  [dependency graph](dependency-graph-rendering.md) expands into (the merging lives in the graph, not
  here).
- [`crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/dedup.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/dedup.rs) —
  the `DedupLedger` and its span-independent key scheme.
- [`crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/signals.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/signals.rs) —
  the rustc-phrasing predicates the emitter's candidate checks and cleanups key on.
- [`crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/code.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing/src/code.rs) —
  the `CGP-E` error-code constants, catalogued in [error-code.md](../error-code.md).
- [`crates/cargo-cgp-driver/src/emitter/`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/tree/main/crates/cargo-cgp-driver/src/emitter) — the
  driver-side caller: applies the transforms over a `DiagInner`'s messages and span labels after its
  own rewrite.

- [The error pipeline](error-pipeline.md) — the surrounding stages: how rustc is configured to emit
  better diagnostics, how each diagnostic is transformed, and how the result is rendered.
- [The driver](driver.md) — the emitter that drives these transforms, and the wiring rewrite in full.
- [CGP error catalog](../../cgp/errors/README.md) — the error classes the transforms must
  learn to recognize, and where each class hides or surfaces its root cause.
