# Testing

`cargo-cgp` is tested at two levels: fast tests over the argument-handling logic, and a UI snapshot
suite — a custom Rust test harness, in the style of Clippy's — that compiles example CGP programs
through the real tool and pins both its rendered output (`.cgp.stderr`) and — for contrast — the
output plain `cargo check` produces for the same fixture (`.rust.stderr`). Every test lives in its
crate's `tests/` directory; per
[../../AGENTS.md](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/AGENTS.md) the project keeps
no inline `#[cfg(test)]` modules, so all tests are integration tests against a crate's public API.

## The layers of testing

Testing the tool splits along the seam between its two kinds of logic: the ordinary Rust that decides
*how to invoke the compiler* and what to do with its text, and the emergent behavior of *actually
invoking it*. The first is pure and cheap to test; the second only appears when a real `cargo` drives a
real compiler through the driver, so it is exercised by running the whole tool against example crates
and snapshotting what it prints. The argument tests and the two rustc-free libraries' unit tests guard
the former; the UI snapshot suite guards the latter. Each is described below.

## Argument-handling tests

The argument-handling logic on both sides of the tool is tested directly, because it is pure
input-to-output transformation with corner cases that are easy to get wrong and easy to pin. Each
crate's tests live in its `tests/` directory and run under `cargo test` with no toolchain ceremony;
new argument-handling behavior should arrive with a test here rather than a manual check.

Two crates carry these. The front-end's
[`tests/args.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp/tests/args.rs)
checks that `strip_subcommand` drops the cargo-inserted `cgp` token for the `cargo cgp check` form,
leaves the direct form alone, keeps a later token that merely equals `cgp`, and yields nothing when
only the program name is present. The driver's
[`tests/args.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-driver/tests/args.rs)
checks that `rustc_args` strips the injected `rustc` path in wrapper mode, injects `--sysroot` when
absent, keeps an existing sysroot, appends an injected flag when absent, and lets an explicit
`-Znext-solver` override it. (That test links the driver, so — like the driver binary — it carries
the `#![feature(rustc_private)]` gate.) The harness crate additionally tests its own option parsing
and output normalization, also under `tests/`.

## The UI snapshot suite

The UI suite is modeled on Clippy's: a tree of `.rs` fixtures, each paired with committed snapshots,
checked by compiling the fixture and diffing. The fixtures live under
[`tests/ui/`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/tree/main/tests/ui), grouped into three
top-level categories by the *quality of the output* the tool now produces: `acceptable/` for output
that meets the bar — the diagnostic the tool renders is a clean, root-cause-first error a reader can
act on; `usability/` for errors that still carry the cause but bury it, the remaining issues; and
`ok/` for a fixture that compiles clean and needs no diagnostic work. Each fixture `<name>.rs` has
three siblings: `<name>.cgp.stderr`, the tool's rendered output; `<name>.rust.stderr`, what plain
`cargo check` prints for the same fixture — the untransformed "before" against which the tool's
`.cgp.stderr` is the "after"; and `<name>.expand.rs`, the Rust the fixture's CGP macros generate, as
`cargo cgp expand` shows it. A fixture that compiles cleanly has an empty `.cgp.stderr` and an empty
`.rust.stderr`, but still has an `.expand.rs` — every fixture has one, since expansion happens
before type-checking and so succeeds whether or not the fixture compiles.

Within each category the fixtures are sorted into kind subdirectories. `acceptable/` is split by the
kind of failure the tool resolves — `fields/` and `field-types/` for missing and mistyped fields,
`types/` for an abstract type the context and a provider disagree on, `providers/` for provider
dependency chains, `generic/` for generic components, `resolution/` for the non-field and boundary
cases the resolver still reshapes, `use-site/` for consumer-method call failures, `duplication/` for
the de-duplicated and coalesced multi-block cases, and `lowering/` and `wiring/` for the remaining
classes (`wiring/orphan/` holding the cross-crate orphan-rule cases the tool now reshapes into
`[CGP-E011]`). `usability/` is split by the kind of issue that remains — `lowering/` and `wiring/`
(currently just `constraints/`). Alongside the hand-curated examples the tree includes the fixtures
migrated from `cgp`'s former compile-fail suite (one per post-codegen error class), giving the tool
a snapshot of its own transformed output for the whole [error catalog](../../cgp/errors/README.md) —
now maintained here rather than mirrored, since that suite has been removed. The
[usability fixtures README](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/usability/README.md)
records the class-by-class findings.

The suite pins *both* halves of that transformation, so the tool's contribution is legible on the
page. The `.cgp.stderr` is the output of `cargo-cgp` itself — each fixture compiled by running the
real `cargo-cgp check` end to end, front-end, driver, and all, so the snapshot is whatever the tool
emits, already shaped by the driver's emitter. The `.rust.stderr` beside it is the output of plain
`cargo check` on the same fixture, with no driver and no CGP transforms, and it exists as the
recorded "before". Both snapshots come out of the *same* renderer — the compiler's default human
emitter — because the driver renders the human path itself, so the only difference between them is
the transforms the driver applied; their diff is therefore purely the tool's work, cleaner than a
diff across two different renderers would be. Reading the two side by side shows exactly what the
tool changed — the resugared type names, the renamed wiring traits, the CGP error codes on the
messages it fully rewrites. As the tool reshapes more diagnostics in the driver's emitter, the
`.cgp.stderr` is what will change while the `.rust.stderr` stays fixed, so the widening gap between
them is the visible measure of the tool's work, and the `.cgp.stderr` diff is the signal that a
change did what was intended. The suite exists so that is caught the moment it lands.

### Three passes per fixture

Each fixture is verified by three passes: two about what the compiler *says* — the tool's real
output and the plain-compiler baseline it improves on — and one about what the macros *generate*.
They do not cross-check each other, and there is no separate capture or unit pass — because the
driver applies every CGP transform in-process and renders the result, `.cgp.stderr` is simply what
`cargo-cgp` prints, with nothing to reconcile it against. All three are implemented in
[`passes`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-ui-tests/src/passes.rs):

- **The cgp-stderr pass** runs `cargo-cgp check` directly and compares the tool's rendered stderr to
  `<name>.cgp.stderr`. This is the end-to-end check that the whole binary produces the expected output.
- **The rust-stderr pass** runs plain `cargo check` — no `cargo-cgp`, no driver — and compares its
  rendered stderr to `<name>.rust.stderr`. Nothing cross-checks it, because it is the untransformed
  compiler output, not a tool result; it exists to record the "before" the cgp-stderr pass improves on.
- **The expand pass** runs `cargo cgp expand` and compares its **stdout** to `<name>.expand.rs`. It is
  the only pass whose artifact is not a diagnostic, and it earns its place twice over: it makes every
  fixture's *generated code* visible beside the error about it — which is where the answer to "why does
  it say that?" usually is — and it is the end-to-end coverage of
  [the expand command](expand-command.md) and the syntax-tree
  [resugaring](resugaring.md) it drives, neither of which any other test exercises through a real
  compilation.

The expand pass normalizes less than the other two, deliberately. Only the absolute paths are replaced;
none of the diagnostic normalization applies, and one piece of it would actively hide a defect — the
`Chars<…>` spine collapse exists to absorb how rustc truncates a spine in a *diagnostic*, but in an
expansion a raw `Chars<…>` spine means the resugaring declined, which is exactly what the snapshot is
there to show. (Across the current tree, no expansion contains one outside a fixture's own doc
comment.)

Two small things follow from an `.expand.rs` being Rust. The fixture collector skips `*.expand.rs`, or
a snapshot would be collected as a fixture and then expanded in turn; and a fixture that fails *during*
macro expansion has no expansion to record, so its snapshot holds a one-line marker saying so — a fact
worth pinning, since it says the failure precedes type-checking. No fixture in the tree is in that
state today.

### The harness is a custom Rust test binary

Following Clippy, the suite is a **custom test harness written in Rust**, not a shell script and not
libtest. It lives in its own crate,
[`crates/cargo-cgp-ui-tests`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/tree/main/crates/cargo-cgp-ui-tests),
whose `ui` test target sets `harness = false` and provides its own `fn main`
([`tests/ui.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-ui-tests/tests/ui.rs))
— the same shape as Clippy's `tests/compile-test.rs`. The `fn main` is thin; the logic is in the
crate's library so it stays small and testable, split into focused modules: `options` (argument
parsing), `paths` (locating the workspace, fixtures, cgp checkout, and built binaries), `fixtures`
(discovery), `harness` (building the binaries and compiling a fixture in a worker crate, through
`cargo-cgp` or plain `cargo`), `passes` (the two per-fixture passes), `runner` (scheduling fixtures
across the worker pool), `aux` (materializing the auxiliary crates a fixture depends on — below),
`normalize` (rewriting volatile paths and dropping content-free lines out of the output), and
`snapshot` (compare, bless, diff).

The harness crate is a full workspace member, so `cargo test` runs the whole suite alongside the
argument tests. It shells out to `cargo` and `cargo-cgp` and carries no non-std dependencies of its
own — the driver does every diagnostic transform in-process, so the harness only launches processes
and diffs their output, with no need to link the tool's libraries. Running the full suite builds the
front-end and its driver and expects a sibling `cgp` checkout at `../cgp` (which each throwaway crate
depends on by path), so a plain `cargo test` needs both present.

### How a fixture is compiled

A fixture is a loose `.rs` file, so the harness turns it into a crate the tool can check: it
maintains a throwaway crate that depends on `cgp` by path, copies the fixture in as its `src/main.rs`,
and runs `cargo-cgp check -q --color never` there. Naming the crate `ui` keeps cargo's output stable,
and an empty `[workspace]` table in its manifest stops cargo from folding it into the `cargo-cgp`
workspace above it in `target/`. In a full run each of the three passes compiles the fixture once — the
tool, plain `cargo check`, and `cargo cgp expand` — and re-copying it before each run bumps its mtime,
which forces cargo to recompile and re-emit rather than serve a cached build with nothing to say. The
expand pass shares the `cargo-cgp` passes' target directory and profile, so it reuses their cached
dependency builds; cargo re-runs only the fixture crate itself, whose expansion produces no artifact.

A cross-crate scenario — the orphan rule, cross-crate coherence — cannot live in one crate, so a
fixture may pull in **auxiliary crates** with a header directive (`//@aux-build: cgp-test-crate-a`),
the same mechanism Clippy's `aux-build` provides. The `aux` module materializes every stored
auxiliary crate once, up front: it copies the crate's source from
[`crates/cargo-cgp-ui-tests/auxiliary/`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/tree/main/crates/cargo-cgp-ui-tests/auxiliary)
into `target/ui-harness/aux/` and generates its manifest there, substituting the resolved
sibling-`cgp` path (the same path the worker crates use) for the placeholder the stored manifest
carries. When a fixture declares an auxiliary crate, the harness rewrites the worker crate's
manifest to add it as a path dependency before any pass runs; a transitive auxiliary dependency (one
aux crate's `../other-aux` path) resolves through the shared materialized sibling. Because a
worker's manifest is rewritten only when its dependency set actually changes, a run of ordinary
(no-aux) fixtures never disturbs the cached `cgp` build. This is what lets the three cross-crate
orphan-rule fixtures and the positive `ok/cross_crate_wiring.rs` reproduce failures a single crate
cannot.

The rust-stderr pass builds in a *separate* target directory from the `cargo-cgp` pass —
`target-rust/` beside the worker crate's default `target/`. The reason is cargo's fingerprinting:
`cargo-cgp` sets `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` and plain `cargo` does not, and that variable is part of
the fingerprint, so sharing one target directory would rebuild `cgp` on every alternation between the
wrapped and unwrapped runs. Two directories keep each variant's `cgp` build cached, at the cost of
compiling `cgp` a second time per worker.

Fixtures are checked in parallel, and the shape of that parallelism is dictated by one cargo
constraint: a `cargo` build holds an exclusive lock on its target directory for the whole build, so
two checks can only overlap if they build in *separate* target directories. The harness therefore
runs a **pool of workers**, each owning its own throwaway crate under
`target/ui-harness/worker-<n>/` (so each gets its own target directory), and hands fixtures to
whichever worker is free (the `runner` module). Reusing a worker's crate across the fixtures it picks
up keeps `cgp` compiled and cached *within* that worker; the price of the isolation is that `cgp` is
built once per worker rather than once overall. The worker count defaults to the machine's
parallelism, capped at both 8 and the fixture count, and is overridable with `--jobs`/`-j` (below) —
the cap keeps a many-core machine from starting so many parallel `cgp` builds that the compilation and
disk cost outweighs the parallelism, and `--jobs` raises it again on a machine that can afford more. Each worker's crate directory carries the worker number, but that
absolute path is normalized to `$DIR`, so a snapshot never depends on which worker produced it. Each
fixture's result is printed the moment it finishes rather than held to the end, so a run streams live;
the order is therefore completion order, not fixture order, which is why every line names its fixture.

The `-q` removes most of the noise: it suppresses cargo's own progress lines (`Checking`,
`Compiling`, `Finished`). What remains and must be normalized away is machine-specific or
non-diagnostic: the absolute paths of the `cgp` checkout and the throwaway crate, the cargo
build-failure summary (`could not compile …`, which is cargo's own output rather than part of any
diagnostic), and a note pointing at a hash-named temp file when a long type is elided. The
driver's `--verbose` suppresses that elision, so the temp-file note never reaches a `.cgp.stderr`; but
the rust-stderr pass runs plain `cargo check` *without* `--verbose`, so a long CGP type can be elided
there and the note does arise in `.rust.stderr` — which is exactly why dropping it earns its keep. The
single `normalize` module handles the rendered stderr of both passes: it rewrites the paths to
`$CGP`/`$DIR` and drops the summary and temp-file lines, so what is compared depends only on the
diagnostic content. Normalization applies to the compared/blessed output only; `--print` shows the raw output untouched.
The harness finds the built `cargo-cgp` beside its own test binary in `target/debug`, having first
built both binaries with `cargo build` (the front-end locates the driver as its sibling).

### Running and blessing

The suite is part of `cargo test`; to run only it, select the crate:

```sh
cargo test                                  # everything (the argument tests + the UI suite)
cargo test -p cargo-cgp-ui-tests            # only the suite
```

To pass an argument to the harness, target the `ui` test explicitly with `--test ui`, so the flag is
not also handed to the crate's other (libtest) tests. The harness accepts a path substring to filter
fixtures, `--bless` to rewrite the snapshots, `--print` to show a fixture's raw output instead of
comparing, and `--jobs N` (`-j N`) to set the worker count:

```sh
cargo test -p cargo-cgp-ui-tests --test ui -- usability    # only fixtures whose path contains "usability"
cargo test -p cargo-cgp-ui-tests --test ui -- --bless      # rewrite all three snapshots per fixture
cargo test -p cargo-cgp-ui-tests --test ui -- -j 4                    # check at most 4 fixtures at once
cargo test -q -p cargo-cgp-ui-tests --test ui -- --print unsatisfied_dependency  # print raw output
```

**`--jobs N`** (`-j N`) sets how many fixtures the harness checks at once; it defaults to the
machine's parallelism, capped at 8 and at the number of fixtures. Raise it past the default on a
machine that can afford more concurrent `cgp` builds — one per worker, since the workers cannot share
a target directory (above) — or set `-j 1` to run fully sequentially.

After an *intended* change to what the tool emits, `--bless` regenerates all three snapshots — the
analogue of Clippy's `cargo bless` — writing `.cgp.stderr` from the real `cargo-cgp` run,
`.rust.stderr` from plain `cargo check`, and `.expand.rs` from `cargo cgp expand`, and the diff is
reviewed before committing. The three move for different reasons, which is what makes a diff
informative: `.cgp.stderr` changes when the tool's diagnostics change, `.rust.stderr` only on a
toolchain bump, and `.expand.rs` when a CGP macro's expansion changes or when the resugaring does —
so an unexpected `.expand.rs` diff after a `cgp` update is a report of what the macros now generate.

### Toolchain and determinism

A snapshot is only reproducible against the toolchain it was blessed with, because it contains the
compiler's diagnostic text. The harness builds and runs under the toolchain the repository pins in
[`rust-toolchain.toml`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/rust-toolchain.toml)
(overridable with `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN`), and snapshots must be blessed under that same toolchain. A
deliberate toolchain bump can therefore change the diagnostic wording and require a re-bless,
exactly as it does for Clippy — a `.cgp.stderr` or `.rust.stderr` diff after a toolchain change is
expected, not a regression. An `.expand.rs` is steadier, since it holds generated *source* rather
than compiler prose, but it too is toolchain-dependent: the compiler's own pretty-printer lays it
out, and the injected `#![feature(prelude_import)]`/`extern crate std` preamble comes from the
edition's prelude. A passing `acceptable/use-site/unsatisfied_dependency` snapshot is also the
standing proof that the driver genuinely stands in as the compiler, since its un-hidden root cause
could only be produced by compiling the fixture through the tool.

## Comparison with Clippy

The suite now matches Clippy's *approach* closely: a custom Rust test harness with `harness = false`
and its own `fn main`, driving a tree of `tests/ui/*.rs` fixtures against committed snapshots with a
bless step. The mental model transfers directly, and
[`external/rust-clippy/tests/compile-test.rs`](../../../external/rust-clippy/tests/compile-test.rs)
is the reference to read alongside this crate. Two deliberate differences remain.

First, the harness is **hand-rolled rather than built on the [`ui_test`](https://github.com/oli-obk/ui_test)
library** Clippy uses. `ui_test` invokes a compiler directly on each fixture and, via its
`DependencyBuilder`, computes the `--extern`/`-L` flags needed to make a dependency like `cgp`
available. The hand-rolled harness sidesteps that machinery — and the version-coupling of a large
test dependency — by driving the whole `cargo-cgp` tool through `cargo`, which resolves `cgp` for us.
The cost is that compilation goes through cargo (its progress noise, quieted with `-q`) instead of
straight to the compiler.

Second, and following from that, the harness **drives the whole tool, where Clippy's `ui_test`
drives `clippy-driver` directly**. Driving the front-end is a stronger end-to-end test — it exercises
`cargo-cgp` as a user invokes it — and it is what makes the cargo-resolves-`cgp` shortcut possible.
If the suite grows enough to want per-diagnostic control (inline `//~` annotations, rustfix, and the
like), adopting `ui_test` pointed at `cargo-cgp-driver` is the natural next step.

A third, smaller difference is that the suite pins *two* snapshots per fixture where Clippy pins one.
The extra one is the `.rust.stderr` baseline: it records plain `cargo check`, which Clippy never
needs because it only *adds* lints to rustc's output rather than rewriting it, so it has no "before"
worth pinning. `cargo-cgp` rewrites, so the before/after pairing is what makes the rewrite legible.
There is no unit-test pass against Clippy's either, and none is possible: the driver applies its
transforms in-process while rendering, so there is no separately renderable stage to check apart from
the end-to-end run.

One gap against Clippy is unrelated to the harness: there is no dogfood test that runs `cargo-cgp` on
this repository's own crates. It becomes worthwhile as the tool's diagnostic transforms grow, when
running them against real crates would catch regressions the curated fixtures miss.

## Further reading

These are the snapshot harnesses this suite's design draws on; both compile each fixture and diff a
committed snapshot with a bless step, the workflow reproduced here.

- [`ui_test`](https://github.com/oli-obk/ui_test) — the UI-test library Clippy's harness is built on.
- [`trybuild`](https://docs.rs/trybuild) — the compile-fail snapshot harness `cgp` formerly used for
  its post-codegen failures, before those cases were migrated into this suite.

## Tests

The automated tests are the argument-handling tests, the harness crate's option-parsing and
normalization tests, and the UI snapshot suite — all under each crate's `tests/` directory. There is
no dogfood test yet (see above).

- [`crates/cargo-cgp/tests/args.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp/tests/args.rs) — `strip_subcommand` across
  the `cargo cgp check` form, the direct form, a later matching token, and the program-name-only case.
- [`crates/cargo-cgp-driver/tests/args.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-driver/tests/args.rs) — `rustc_args`
  across wrapper-mode stripping, sysroot injection, an existing sysroot, injected-flag appending, and
  an explicit `-Znext-solver` override.
- [`crates/cargo-cgp-ui-tests/tests/options.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-ui-tests/tests/options.rs),
  [`crates/cargo-cgp-ui-tests/tests/normalize.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-ui-tests/tests/normalize.rs)
  — harness option/filter parsing and the output normalizer.
- [`tests/ui/`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/tree/main/tests/ui) — the UI snapshot fixtures, each `<name>.rs` paired with a blessed
  `<name>.cgp.stderr` (the tool's output) and `<name>.rust.stderr` (the plain-`cargo check`
  baseline) and its `.expand.rs` generated code, run by the harness's three passes.
