# Executable structure

`cargo-cgp` is two cooperating executables — a front-end that wraps `cargo` and a driver that wraps
`rustc` — so that it can watch a real compilation through the compiler's own `rustc_driver` API
while presenting an ordinary cargo subcommand to the user.

## Why two executables

The tool is split into two binaries because only one of them may link the compiler internals, and
keeping that linkage isolated keeps the other binary small and ordinary. The **`cargo-cgp` crate**
([`crates/cargo-cgp`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/tree/main/crates/cargo-cgp)) is
the front-end: the cargo subcommand a user invokes, a plain `std` + `anyhow` binary. The
**`cargo-cgp-driver` crate**
([`crates/cargo-cgp-driver`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/tree/main/crates/cargo-cgp-driver))
is the driver: a `rustc` replacement that links the compiler's unstable `rustc_driver` library under
the `rustc_private` feature. If the two lived in one binary, the front-end would drag the compiler
dylib — and LLVM — behind every invocation; splitting them means the front-end builds and runs as a
normal tool, and the heavyweight linkage is confined to the process that actually needs it.

This is the same split Clippy uses, `cargo-clippy` to `clippy-driver`, and for the same reason. A
third crate, the library-only
[`cargo-cgp-error-processing`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/tree/main/crates/cargo-cgp-error-processing),
holds the driver's rustc-free string helpers — the wiring rename, the text post-processing, and the
dependency-tree rendering. It links no compiler internals, so the driver drives those helpers while
keeping them out of its `rustc_private` linkage and buildable on any toolchain (see
[Error processing](error-processing.md)). The mechanism that connects the two executables is cargo's
wrapper protocol, described next.

## Wrapping cargo: the front-end

The front-end's whole job is to run cargo with the driver installed as the compiler cargo uses for
the user's own crates — `cargo check` for a check, `cargo rustc` for an expansion (see
[The expand command](expand-command.md)). It does this with the `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` environment
variable, which tells cargo to invoke a wrapper in place of `rustc` for each *workspace* crate while
leaving dependencies to compile with the normal compiler. Scoping to the workspace is deliberate:
the point of the tool is the user's code, not their dependency tree.

The entrypoint is
[`run::run`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp/src/run.rs),
which the thin
[`bin/cargo-cgp.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp/bin/cargo-cgp.rs)
wrapper calls. It first normalizes the process arguments, because the tool is reachable two ways
that must reduce to the same thing:

```text
cargo cgp check --workspace   →  cargo-cgp  cgp  check --workspace   (cargo inserts "cgp")
cargo-cgp check --workspace   →  cargo-cgp       check --workspace   (invoked directly)
```

[`args::strip_subcommand`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp/src/args.rs)
drops the program name and a *leading* `cgp` token if present, leaving `["check", ...]` in both
cases, and
[`run::dispatch`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp/src/run.rs)
routes on the first remaining word. Four subcommands exist: `check` (below), `expand` (show the Rust
a target's CGP macros generate, see [The expand command](expand-command.md)), `setup` (provision the
pinned toolchain and driver), and `update` (upgrade the tool) — the last two are covered in
[Distribution](distribution.md). Anything after `check` is forwarded verbatim to `cargo check`, so
`cargo cgp check -v` and `cargo cgp check --workspace` behave as expected. A leading `--help`/`-h`,
or no subcommand at all, prints the front-end help text
([`help::help_text`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp/src/help.rs))
and exits successfully, so a bare `cargo cgp` is a friendly overview rather than an error.

[`launch::wrapped_cargo`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp/src/launch/command.rs)
then builds the wrapped command, which
[`check::run_check`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp/src/check.rs)
runs (`expand` builds on the same function — see [The expand command](expand-command.md)). It sets
`RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` to the driver's path — located by
[`launch::driver_path`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp/src/launch/driver_path.rs)
as a sibling of the running front-end executable, since cargo and rustup lay the two binaries down
together — and hands the driver the two further things it needs through the environment (the next
section).

The front-end passes cargo's output straight through rather than reshaping it. It inherits cargo's
stdio (`command.status()`) and touches nothing on the diagnostic stream, so cargo's progress lines
and the compiler's diagnostics appear live at the terminal, exactly as a plain `cargo check` would.
Every CGP transform happens inside the driver's emitter, which renders the finished diagnostics in
whatever format the invocation asks for — human text by default, JSON when the caller requests it —
so the front-end never sees, parses, or re-emits a diagnostic itself. Throughout, the exit code of
the `cargo` process is propagated, so a failed check fails the command. The [error
pipeline](error-pipeline.md) documents where the transforms happen and what they will grow into.

## Wrapping rustc: the driver

Cargo invokes the driver the way `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` prescribes — the wrapper name, then the
real compiler path, then the rustc arguments:

```text
cargo-cgp-driver  /path/to/rustc  --edition=2024  --crate-name foo  src/lib.rs  ...
```

The driver runs the real compiler in-process rather than shelling out, which is the whole reason for
its existence: only in-process, through
[`rustc_driver`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-driver/src/run.rs),
can it read and rewrite the compilation's diagnostics. The entrypoint is
[`run::run`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-driver/src/run.rs),
called by the thin
[`bin/cargo-cgp-driver.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-driver/bin/cargo-cgp-driver.rs)
wrapper; it prepares the rustc argument vector (dropping the injected `rustc` path and injecting the
sysroot and the diagnostic flags), runs the compiler under `catch_with_exit_code`, and installs a
custom emitter that transforms the diagnostics and renders them — as human text or JSON, matching
whatever format the invocation asks for, like vanilla `rustc`.

All of that — the argument preparation, the `rustc_private` compiler-API access, and the three
diagnostic transformations — is the subject of the [driver deep dive](driver.md); this document
covers only how the driver sits between cargo and the compiler, and the environment contract it needs
to do so.

## The environment contract

The front-end and the driver are separate processes, so what one must tell the other travels through
the environment. Two pieces of state cross that boundary, and both exist because the driver lives
*outside* any toolchain — in `target/debug` or `~/.cargo/bin`, not in the toolchain's `bin`
directory — so the compiler cannot infer from the driver's own location things it normally would.

Underneath both, the front-end forces `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` to the pinned nightly for the wrapped
`cargo check`, so the sysroot it discovers and the `librustc_driver` the driver loads both belong to
the nightly the driver embeds, whatever toolchain the project itself pins. That forcing, and the
preflight that precedes it, are part of [Distribution](distribution.md#the-pinned-toolchain-is-an-internal-detail);
this section covers the two pieces of state the forcing then makes coherent.

The front-end passes the **sysroot** through `CARGO_CGP_SYSROOT`. It discovers the value by running
`rustc --print sysroot`
([`launch::sysroot`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp/src/launch/sysroot.rs))
and the driver reads it back to inject `--sysroot`
([`config::SYSROOT_ENV`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp-driver/src/config.rs)),
because a `rustc_driver` binary that is not inside a toolchain has no other way to locate `std`. The
two crates declare the variable name independently; the shared string is the contract between them.

The front-end also prepends the sysroot's `lib` directory to the OS **dynamic-library search path**
— `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, or its platform equivalent
([`launch::command`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/crates/cargo-cgp/src/launch/command.rs))
— so the loader can find `librustc_driver` when cargo spawns the driver. The driver links that
library dynamically from the sysroot, and nothing else would put it on the search path.

## Accessing the Rust compiler API

The driver links the compiler's internal crates from the sysroot through the `rustc_private` feature,
which is what its in-process access to the compiler rests on. How that linkage works — the
`extern crate` declarations, the feature gate needed on both the library and the binary, and the
pinned-nightly requirement — is part of the [driver deep dive](driver.md#accessing-the-rust-compiler-api).

## Comparison with Clippy

`cargo-cgp` is modeled closely on Clippy, and the shared skeleton is easiest to see first. Both are
a front-end plus a driver; both set `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` to the driver and then run a cargo
subcommand; both locate the driver as a sibling of the front-end via `current_exe`; both detect
wrapper mode by testing whether the second argument's file stem is `rustc` and drop it; both inject
`--sysroot` only when one is absent; and both run the compiler with `rustc_driver::run_compiler`
inside `catch_with_exit_code`. Reading
[`external/rust-clippy/src/driver.rs`](../../../external/rust-clippy/src/driver.rs) and
[`external/rust-clippy/src/main.rs`](../../../external/rust-clippy/src/main.rs) alongside our two
crates, the correspondence is close enough to map function for function.

The differences fall into two groups: a few are structural, forced by how the tool is distributed,
and the rest are simplifications `cargo-cgp` has not yet needed to undo.

The structural difference is the sysroot. `clippy-driver` ships *inside* the toolchain, next to
`rustc`, so the compiler infers the sysroot from the driver's own location and Clippy injects
`--sysroot` only in the rare case its `SYSROOT` variable is set; it never puts anything on the
dynamic-library path. `cargo-cgp-driver` is an out-of-tree binary in `target/debug`, so it cannot
rely on either inference — hence the front-end proactively computes the sysroot with
`rustc --print sysroot`, passes it in `CARGO_CGP_SYSROOT`, and prepends the sysroot `lib` to the
loader path. This is the one place `cargo-cgp` must do materially more than Clippy, and it follows
directly from not being a rustup component.

The remaining differences are gaps, where `cargo-cgp` is deliberately simpler than Clippy today and
will likely grow toward it. The one that is a front-end concern lives here; the driver-side gaps —
argument reading, driver front-matter, info-query handling, and the `Callbacks` set — are catalogued
in the [driver deep dive](driver.md#comparison-with-clippy).

- **Front-end argument forwarding.** `cargo-cgp` forwards extra arguments straight to `cargo check`.
  Clippy packs its own arguments into a `CLIPPY_ARGS` variable with a separator hack and chooses
  between the `check` and `fix` cargo subcommands; `cargo-cgp` has no tool-specific arguments and
  only `check`, so it needs none of that.

## Further reading

The wrapper-and-driver approach is not unique to this tool, and the two mechanisms it rests on —
cargo's compiler-wrapper protocol and the `rustc_driver` API — are documented authoritatively
elsewhere in more depth than this document repeats. Read these when you need the full contract behind
a behavior described above.

- [Environment Variables — The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html)
  defines `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` and `RUSTC_WRAPPER`: cargo runs the wrapper with the real `rustc`
  path as its first argument, the workspace variant applies only to workspace members, and it affects
  the artifact hash so wrapped builds cache separately. This is the exact protocol the front-end
  drives and the driver decodes in wrapper mode.

The authoritative references for the compiler-side mechanisms — `rustc_driver`, the `Callbacks`
trait, custom emitters, and the `rustc_private` feature — are collected in the
[driver deep dive](driver.md#further-reading).

## Tests

The front-end's argument normalization is tested directly, and the end-to-end wrapping is verified by
hand. The full testing picture, including the example fixtures and the verification checklist, is its
own document: [Testing](testing.md); the driver's own argument and rewrite tests are listed in the
[driver deep dive](driver.md#tests).
