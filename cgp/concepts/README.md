# CGP Concepts

This directory holds the high-level conceptual overviews that tie the CGP constructs together — the consumer/provider duality, dependency injection, namespaces, handlers, and so on. Each document explains one cross-cutting idea and points down into the [reference documents](../reference/README.md) for the per-construct mechanics, so a reader can grasp the shape of an idea here and follow the links for the precise semantics.

## How concepts differ from reference documents and examples

A concept document explains an *idea that spans several constructs*, whereas a [reference document](../reference/README.md) explains a *single construct completely* and an [example](../../examples/README.md) develops a *single use case end to end*. A fourth section, [guides](../guides/README.md), is different again: a concept explains *what an idea is*, while a guide directs *which choice to make* when writing CGP code. These are complementary. The reference for `delegate_components!` states its syntax and exact expansion; the [coherence](coherence.md) concept explains *why* CGP wires components through such a table at all, and the [modular serialization](../../examples/modular-serialization.md) example shows the pattern solving a real problem. A concept document carries only enough mechanism to make the idea legible and links to the reference for the rest, so a reader who wants the detail follows the link while a reader who wants the framing stays here.

## The catalog

The authoring rules for concept documents, including when a cross-cutting idea earns its own page, live in [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). These documents explain the ideas that connect the constructs, each linking down to the per-construct references for the detail.

- [Bypassing coherence](coherence.md) — what Rust's coherence rules forbid, and the incoherent-impl-plus-local-wiring strategy CGP uses to work around them.
- [Modularity hierarchy](modularity-hierarchy.md) — the hierarchy from a single blanket impl to per-type-per-provider wiring, the two axes that decide a tier (whether the context is a **value context** or an **environmental** one, and whether the component is **self-targeted** or **parameter-targeted**), and how to pick the lowest tier a use case needs. Read it before writing a document whose examples span more than one of those shapes, since nothing in a signature marks the difference and a reader who generalizes from one loses the meaning of "context".
- [Consumer and provider traits](consumer-and-provider-traits.md) — the trait duality at the heart of CGP and how it sidesteps coherence.
- [Impl-side dependencies](impl-side-dependencies.md) — dependency injection through the `where` clause of blanket impls.
- [Implicit arguments](implicit-arguments.md) — writing providers as ordinary functions whose arguments come from context fields.
- [Higher-order providers](higher-order-providers.md) — providers parameterized by other providers.
- [Check traits](check-traits.md) — why wiring is lazy and how to verify it at compile time.
- [Abstract types](abstract-types.md) — abstract associated types shared and swapped across contexts.
- [Modular error handling](modular-error-handling.md) — an abstract error type plus raising and wrapping capabilities, with the error type and construction strategy chosen by wiring.
- [Aggregate providers](aggregate-providers.md) — bundling a group of component wirings into a reusable provider that contexts delegate to as a unit, and why such a bundle is a provider rather than a context.
- [Namespaces](namespaces.md) — reusable, inheritable wiring tables and preset-style configuration.
- [Handlers](handlers.md) — the Computer/Producer/Handler family of computation components and their sync/async/fallible/by-reference variants.
- [Extensible records](extensible-records.md) — building and reading a struct by its named fields, and the extensible builder pattern.
- [Extensible variants](extensible-variants.md) — constructing and deconstructing an enum by its named variants, and the extensible visitor pattern.
- [Dispatching](dispatching.md) — routing extensible-data inputs to per-field and per-variant handlers.
- [Monadic handlers](monadic-handlers.md) — composing handlers through the identity/ok/err monads.
- [Type-level DSLs](type-level-dsls.md) — encoding a small language as types and interpreting it at compile time through CGP wiring.
- [Recovering `Send` bounds](send-bounds.md) — restoring the `Send` guarantee an async trait method drops, as a stand-in for the Return Type Notation stable Rust lacks.
