# Implicit arguments

Implicit arguments are a programming model in which a provider is written like an ordinary function taking arguments, where arguments marked `#[implicit]` are sourced not from the caller but from fields of the context.

## The idea

A provider almost always needs values from its context, and CGP makes asking for them look like asking for function parameters. Instead of declaring a `HasField` bound and calling `get_field` inside the body, the author writes a normal-looking parameter — `#[implicit] width: f64` — that reads as "this function needs a `width` of type `f64`." The macro removes that parameter from the public signature, adds the matching field bound, and binds the value at the top of the body, so the code keeps the shape of a plain function while behaving like a provider that pulls its inputs from the context.

This framing is the recommended on-ramp to CGP precisely because it requires no new vocabulary. A programmer who understands functions and arguments can write a complete provider without first meeting `HasField`, type-level symbols, or `PhantomData` tags; those mechanics stay hidden behind a parameter that looks ordinary. The model defers the underlying machinery until the author has a reason to care about it.

## How CGP expresses it

An implicit argument is a function parameter carrying the [`#[implicit]`](../reference/attributes/implicit.md) attribute, whose name doubles as the context field name it reads from. The attribute is meaningful inside the two macros that rewrite function bodies into providers: [`#[cgp_fn]`](../reference/macros/cgp_fn.md), which turns a free function into a single-implementation capability, and [`#[cgp_impl]`](../reference/macros/cgp_impl.md), which writes a provider for an existing component. In both, the marked argument disappears from the signature and is fetched from the context instead.

```rust
use cgp::prelude::*;

#[cgp_fn]
pub fn rectangle_area(&self, #[implicit] width: f64, #[implicit] height: f64) -> f64 {
    width * height
}
```

The desugaring is the impl-side dependency pattern applied to values: each implicit argument becomes a [`HasField`](../reference/traits/has_field.md) bound on the generated impl and a `let` binding that reads the field at the top of the body. The function above generates a `RectangleArea` trait whose method takes no arguments, and a blanket impl requiring `HasField<Symbol!("width"), Value = f64>` and the matching `height` bound, with `width` and `height` read from the context before the body runs. The same rewrite happens identically inside a [`#[cgp_impl]`](../reference/macros/cgp_impl.md) method, where the bounds join the provider impl's `where` clause. The field bounds are satisfied by any context that derives [`#[derive(HasField)]`](../reference/derives/derive_has_field.md) and carries fields of the matching names — no wiring is involved for `#[cgp_fn]`, since its blanket impl applies to every context that has the fields.

Because the argument name is the field name, the values are addressed by name through the type-level symbol [`HasField`](../reference/traits/has_field.md) uses internally, and the whole `Symbol!`/`get_field`/`PhantomData` apparatus stays out of sight. What the author sees is a function with arguments; what the compiler sees is a provider with injected dependencies.

## Access rules

The argument type controls how the field is read, following a small set of rules so that the body receives a value of exactly the declared type. The default rule is that an owned argument type, such as `f64` or `String`, reads the field by reference and appends `.clone()`, so the body gets an owned value while the context keeps its field. The one special case worth memorizing is `&str`: an argument typed `&str` is backed by a `String` field and read with `.as_str()` rather than `.clone()`, letting the body borrow without forcing the context to store a `&str`.

These same rules govern getter access in [`#[cgp_auto_getter]`](../reference/macros/cgp_auto_getter.md), so an author who learns them once applies them everywhere field values are read. The shared rule of thumb is that the declared type is what the body works with, and the macro inserts whatever conversion — a clone for owned values, an `.as_str()` for `&str` — bridges it to the stored field. A few further forms exist for references, options, and slices, all documented with [`#[implicit]`](../reference/attributes/implicit.md).

## When to use which

An implicit argument is the default way to read a context field, and a getter trait is the exception reserved for publishing a reusable capability. Both read fields through `HasField` and share the same access rules, so the choice is not about mechanics but about what the value *is*. An implicit argument treats the value as a private input to one provider: it is bound as a local at the top of the method and used freely from there, which covers reading a field once, using it throughout a body, or declaring it on each of several methods that need it. This is the form to reach for whenever a provider simply needs a value from its context.

A getter trait written with [`#[cgp_auto_getter]`](../reference/macros/cgp_auto_getter.md) is worth defining only in the cases an implicit argument cannot reach. Because an implicit argument reads only from the provider's own `self` and takes a plain `&T` by reference without cloning, it covers every same-context read — even a field several providers each consume, declared as the same implicit argument in each. A getter trait earns its keep in three situations it cannot handle: the field lives on a type *other* than the provider's context, so the getter is required as a `where` bound on that type (`Request: HasBasicAuthHeader<Self>`, with no `self` field to read); the accessor must exist as a *named* capability other code depends on through `#[uses(HasName)]` or a supertrait; or the getter carries an associated type inferred from the field so the type stays abstract for callers. Everywhere else, prefer the implicit argument. The full wireable getter, [`#[cgp_getter]`](../reference/macros/cgp_getter.md), is a further step still, reserved for the advanced case of choosing the source field per context at wiring time.

## Related constructs

The [`#[implicit]`](../reference/attributes/implicit.md) attribute is the construct itself, usable inside [`#[cgp_fn]`](../reference/macros/cgp_fn.md) and [`#[cgp_impl]`](../reference/macros/cgp_impl.md) — the former producing a single-implementation capability with no wiring, the latter a provider for a [`#[cgp_component]`](../reference/macros/cgp_component.md). All of them desugar implicit arguments into [`HasField`](../reference/traits/has_field.md) bounds, which a context supplies by deriving [`#[derive(HasField)]`](../reference/derives/derive_has_field.md).

For the narrow cases an implicit argument cannot reach — a field on another type, a named shared accessor, or a getter with an inferred associated type — [`#[cgp_auto_getter]`](../reference/macros/cgp_auto_getter.md) is the getter-trait counterpart that shares the same `.clone()`/`.as_str()` access rules; everywhere else, a provider reading a field should prefer an implicit argument. The whole model is value-level [impl-side dependencies](impl-side-dependencies.md): an implicit argument is a context dependency injected through a `where`-clause `HasField` bound and dressed as a function parameter.
