# The `delegate_component` AST stack

The `delegate_component` stack is the set of AST types that `delegate_components!` (and, for its wiring half, [`delegate_and_check_components!`](../entrypoints/delegate_and_check_components.md)) parses the macro body into and lowers to impls. The top is `DelegateTable`; below it the body is a `DelegateEntries` of leading statements plus comma-separated mappings, and each mapping pairs a key with a value under one of three operators. Evaluation flows in one direction: the tree lowers to a flat list of `EvaluatedDelegateEntry` values, each of which renders a `DelegateComponent` impl and an `IsProviderFor` impl. The [entrypoint document](../entrypoints/delegate_components.md) covers what the whole pipeline produces; this document covers the types, one per role in the grammar.

## `DelegateTable` and `EvaluatedDelegateTable`

`DelegateTable` is the whole parsed body: outer attributes, an optional leading generic list (`ImplGenerics`), an optional `new` keyword, the target type, and the braced `DelegateEntries`. Its `eval` produces an `EvaluatedDelegateTable` — a bag of `ItemImpl`s and `EmptyStruct`s — whose `ToTokens` emits the structs first, then the impls.

`eval` does three things: if `new` is present it parses the target into an identifier-plus-generics and pushes an `EmptyStruct` for it; it builds the entry impls from `DelegateEntries::build_impls`; and it collects every nested `UseDelegate` inner table (via `ExtractInnerDelegateTables`) and emits each inner table's own struct and impls. The target type and the outer generics are threaded down into every entry so all impls carry the table's generics.

## `DelegateEntries`

`DelegateEntries` is the table body: a `Vec<DelegateStatement>` followed by a `Punctuated<DelegateMapping, Comma>`. Its `Parse` impl peeks for a statement keyword (`namespace`, `open`, or `for`) and consumes all leading statements first, then parses the remaining comma-separated mappings — which is why a statement written after a mapping fails to parse. Its `eval_entries` lowers the statements first, then the mappings, concatenating the evaluated entries; `build_impls` then renders each into its `DelegateComponent`/`IsProviderFor` pair.

## `InnerDelegateTable`

`InnerDelegateTable` is a nested table lifted out of a `UseDelegate<new Inner { … }>` value: an identifier, its generics, and its own `DelegateEntries`. It builds its own `EmptyStruct` and, treating its own identifier-plus-generics as the target type, its own entry impls — so a nested table is evaluated exactly like a top-level one. `ExtractInnerDelegateTables` recurses so that nesting to any depth is flattened into the table's struct-and-impl list.

## `DelegateStatement`

`DelegateStatement` is the leading statement form, an enum over three variants that all lower through `eval_entries` into the same flat entry list:

- **`OpenDelegateStatement`** (`open { A, B };`, or `open A;` for a single component) — opens each listed component for per-value wiring. Its parser peeks for a brace: a `{ … }` list parses one or more comma-separated components, while the braceless form parses exactly one component type, so opening several at once still requires the braces. For each component it emits an entry whose key is the component and whose value is `RedirectLookup<TableType, PathCons<Component, Nil>>`, rooting a redirect at the component name in the context's own table. The `@Component.Key` mappings that follow store providers under the extended path.
- **`NamespaceDelegateStatement`** (`namespace SomeNamespace;`) — forwards every lookup through a namespace trait. It lowers via the shared "for-entry" path to a blanket `DelegateComponent<__Key__>` impl bounded on `__Key__: SomeNamespace<TableType, Delegate = __Value__>`, so any key the namespace defines is inherited.
- **`ForDelegateStatement`** (`for <Key, Provider> in SomeTable where … { … }`) — a loop that pulls mappings out of another lookup table. Each inner mapping produces a for-entry whose namespace-trait bound is reconstructed with the table type and a `Delegate = value` binding appended to the namespace path's arguments.

The namespace and `for` forms share `EvaluatedForEntry` and `eval_delegate_entries_via_for`, which build the `Namespace<…, Delegate = …>` bound and the `__Key__`/`__Value__` generics before producing the final `EvaluatedDelegateEntry`. `EvaluatedForEntry` carries its own diagnostic `span` (the namespace name, or a `for` mapping's key) since its `mapping_key` is a synthesized `__Key__`; it passes that span to the entry.

## `DelegateMapping`

`DelegateMapping` is one comma-separated entry, an enum whose variant is chosen by the operator after the key. `DelegateMode` peeks the operator and drives the split:

- **`NormalDelegateMapping`** (`:`) — maps the key straight to the value type; the evaluated entry's `Delegate` is the value.
- **`DirectDelegateMapping`** (`->`) — forwards to the value's own entry for the key. It sets `Delegate` to `<Value as DelegateComponent<Key>>::Delegate` and adds a `Value: DelegateComponent<Key>` bound to the entry's generics.
- **`RedirectDelegateMapping`** (`=>`) — redirects the lookup along an `@`-path value. It sets `Delegate` to `RedirectLookup<TableType, Path>`, using the path directly for a plain key or a wildcard-terminated prefix for a path key.

Only Normal and Direct mappings can carry a nested inner table (their values are `DelegateValue`); a Redirect value is a bare path and contributes no inner table.

## A key: `DelegateKey`

`DelegateKey` is the left side of a mapping, an enum over three shapes selected by a lookahead on a fork (after skipping any attributes and generics): a leading `@` gives a `PathDelegateKey`, a leading bracket gives a `MultiDelegateKey`, otherwise a `SingleDelegateKey`. `EvalDelegateKey::eval` returns a `Vec<EvaluatedDelegateKey>` (a type, its generics, and a diagnostic `span`), so a single mapping can expand to several keyed impls. The `span` is the source token the key was written as, carried separately because a `@`-path key lowers to a synthesized `PathCons<..>` type whose own span points at the macro `call_site`; it flows into the entry and drives the [error-span re-spanning](../entrypoints/delegate_components.md#error-spans).

- **`SingleDelegateKey`** — attributes, an optional generic list, and a type; evaluates to one key carrying its generics.
- **`MultiDelegateKey`** — a bracketed, comma-separated list of `SingleDelegateKey`; the array-key form, evaluating to one key per element so `[A, B]: P` becomes two impls.
- **`PathDelegateKey`** — the `@`-prefixed open key. It parses a `PathHead` after the `@` and lowers each expanded path to a prefix type terminated by a `__Wildcard__` generic, appending that wildcard to the key's generics. A brace group in the path (`@C.{u32, u64}`) expands to several paths, each becoming its own key. This is what lets a dispatch parameter slot into the redirect path at lookup time.

## A value: `DelegateValue`

`DelegateValue` is the right side of a Normal or Direct mapping, an enum of either a plain `Type` or a `DelegateValueWithInnerTable`. Its `Parse` speculatively tries the inner-table form first and falls back to a bare type.

`DelegateValueWithInnerTable` parses the legacy nested-dispatch shape `Wrapper<new Inner { … }>`: a wrapper identifier, `<`, the `new` keyword, an `InnerDelegateTable`, `>`. Its `eval` produces the value type `Wrapper<Inner…>` (dropping the `new`, which only signals that the inner struct must be declared), and `ExtractInnerDelegateTables` yields the inner table itself so `DelegateTable::eval` emits its struct and impls alongside the outer entry.

## `EvaluatedDelegateEntry`

`EvaluatedDelegateEntry` is the lowered form every key/value/statement collapses to: the target type, the merged generics, the key type, the value (`Delegate`) type, and the diagnostic `span`. It owns the rendering: `build_delegate_component_impl` emits the `DelegateComponent<Key> for TableType { type Delegate = Value; }` impl, and `build_is_provider_for_impl` emits the forwarding `IsProviderFor<Key, __Context__, __Params__>` impl bounded on `Value: IsProviderFor<Key, __Context__, __Params__>`, appending the reserved `__Context__` and `__Params__` generics. Both then pass through `respan_impl`, which re-spans the finished impl's boundary tokens (its `impl` keyword and `{ … }` body) onto the entry's `span` — leaving the interior, including the value and any per-entry generic, at its own spans — so a coherence conflict points at the entry rather than the whole block, while an unconstrained generic's `E0207` still lands on the user's `<T>` — see [Error spans](../entrypoints/delegate_components.md#error-spans). (`build_namespace_impl`, on the same type, is used by the namespace preset machinery to emit a `Namespace for Key` impl instead.)

## Tests

- The stack is exercised end-to-end by the expansion snapshots and behavioral tests indexed in the [entrypoint document](../entrypoints/delegate_components.md), and its attribute rejection — including the recursion through mapping values into inner tables — is pinned by the failure cases in [parser_rejections/delegate_components.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-macro-tests/tests/parser_rejections/delegate_components.rs).

## Source

- The stack lives in [cgp-macro-core/src/types/delegate_component/](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/tree/main/crates/macros/cgp-macro-core/src/types/delegate_component/): the table and `new` keyword in `table/main.rs` and inner tables in `table/inner.rs`; the entries in `entries.rs`; the keys in `key/` (`single.rs`, `multi.rs`, `path.rs`, dispatched in `key/mod.rs`); the values in `value/` (`inner_table.rs`, dispatched in `value/mod.rs`); the mappings and their operator in `mapping/` (`normal.rs`, `direct.rs`, `redirect.rs`, `mode.rs`, and the `EvaluatedDelegateEntry` renderer in `mapping/eval.rs`); and the statements in `statement/` (`open.rs`, `namespace.rs`, `for_loop.rs`, and the shared for-entry evaluator in `statement/eval.rs`).
- Attribute rejection is in `validate_attributes.rs`, path parsing (`PathHead`, `UniPath`) in [types/path/](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/tree/main/crates/macros/cgp-macro-core/src/types/path/), and all impls are built with [parse_internal!](../macros/parse_internal.md).
- The `RedirectLookup` value the `open` and `=>` forms emit is the impl generated by [`#[cgp_component]`](../entrypoints/cgp_component.md).
