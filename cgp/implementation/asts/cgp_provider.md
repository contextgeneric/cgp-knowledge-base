# The `cgp_provider` AST stack

The `cgp_provider` stack is the sequence of AST types that both [`#[cgp_provider]`](../entrypoints/cgp_provider.md) and [`#[cgp_new_provider]`](../entrypoints/cgp_new_provider.md) parse into and lower through — the two macros share this stack entirely and differ only in whether the `new` keyword is set. The argument type `ProviderArgs` and a `syn::ItemImpl` become an `ItemCgpProvider`, whose single `lower` step derives the `IsProviderFor` impl (via `ItemProviderImpl`) and the provider struct (via `EmptyStruct`), packaging all three items into a `LoweredCgpProvider` that renders them. The argument-splitting helper `ProviderImplArgs` supports the `IsProviderFor` derivation. The [`#[cgp_provider]` entrypoint](../entrypoints/cgp_provider.md) covers what the stage produces; this document covers the types.

## `ProviderArgs`

`ProviderArgs` is the parsed attribute argument, shared by both macros: an optional `new` flag and an optional component-type override.

```rust
pub struct ProviderArgs {
    pub new: Option<Keyword<New>>,
    pub component_type: Option<Type>,
}
```

The parser reads only the component type; it never parses the `new` flag from the attribute, so both macros' argument grammar is a bare `ComponentType?`. The `new` flag is set programmatically instead: `#[cgp_provider]` leaves it `None`, `#[cgp_new_provider]` forces it to `Some` after parsing, and when [`#[cgp_impl]`](cgp_impl.md#implargs) lowers to this stack it constructs a `ProviderArgs` from its own `ImplArgs`, copying the `new` and `component_type` fields. Keeping `new` out of the parser means a stray `#[cgp_provider(new Name)]` is not silently treated as a struct declaration — `Name` is left as an unexpected trailing token and rejected.

## `ItemCgpProvider`

`ItemCgpProvider` is the input stage — the args and the provider-trait impl. Its `lower` step drives the whole macro in one pass, delegating to three helpers on itself:

- `component_type` derives the component: it reads the provider trait's identifier and appends `Component` (so `AreaCalculator` → `AreaCalculatorComponent`), unless the attribute supplied an explicit override.
- `ItemProviderImpl::to_is_provider_for_impl` derives the `IsProviderFor` impl.
- `to_provider_struct` derives the provider struct, returning `None` when `new` is unset.

It packages the original `item_impl` (emitted verbatim), the derived `IsProviderFor` impl, and the optional struct into a `LoweredCgpProvider`.

## `ItemProviderImpl` and the `IsProviderFor` derivation

`ItemProviderImpl` pairs a component type with a provider impl and derives the `IsProviderFor` marker impl from it. `to_is_provider_for_impl` clones the provider impl, clears its body, associated types, attributes, `defaultness`, and `unsafety`, and swaps the trait for `IsProviderFor<Component, Context, (Params)>` — keeping the original generic parameters, `where` clause, and the provider impl's own `for` token so the marker holds under exactly the same conditions and none of its structural tokens fall back to the macro `call_site` span (the cloned `impl` keyword, generics, and self type already carry the user's spans; reusing the `for` token keeps the middle of the header from leaking too):

```rust
// from  impl<Context, Code, Input> ComputerRef<Context, Code, Input> for FirstNameToString where …
// to    impl<Context, Code, Input> IsProviderFor<ComputerRefComponent, Context, (Code, Input)>
//           for FirstNameToString where …  {}
```

The derived **component reference** — the `Component` in that `IsProviderFor<Component, …>` — is spanned on `call_site`, not on the provider trait it is derived from. It appears only as this interior type argument, which anchors no error caret (a coherence conflict on the marker reports on the `impl` header, an unmet dependency on the `where`-clause bound), so a narrower span buys nothing at the compiler. It would, though, mislead the editor: rust-analyzer maps a source token to its expansion by source range, so had this reference borrowed the provider trait's span it would share that trait token's range, and go-to-definition on the provider trait a user wrote (in a `#[cgp_impl]` block or a hand-written provider impl) would then offer the component struct as a spurious second target. `call_site` shares no narrow user token's range, keeping the reference out of the editor's way. This is the reference-side dual of the [`#[cgp_component]` marker struct](../entrypoints/cgp_component.md#behavior-and-corner-cases), whose *definition* is instead spanned on the provider identifier so navigation to it lands cleanly; see the [Spans note](../README.md#spans-aim-generated-items-at-the-token-the-user-wrote).

The trait arguments come from `ProviderImplArgs::from_generic_args`, and the derivation ends by running [`replace_provider_in_generics`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/macros/cgp-macro-core/src/visitors/replace_provider.rs) with a map from the provider identifier to the component type, which rewrites a `Provider: SomeTrait<Context, …>` `where`-bound into an `IsProviderFor<…>` bound so a higher-order provider's inner-provider dependency shows up as an `IsProviderFor` obligation.

## `ProviderImplArgs`

`ProviderImplArgs` splits a provider trait's generic arguments into the context type and the `Params` tuple. Walking the arguments in order, it takes the first *type* argument as the context and collects the rest as `Params`; a lifetime always goes into `Params` (its `ToTokens` lifts it to `Life<'a>`) regardless of position, and a `const` argument is rejected with a spanned error. A trait path with no type argument at all is an error, since there is no context to place in the leading position.

## `LoweredCgpProvider`

`LoweredCgpProvider` is the output stage — a bag of the three emitted items. Its `ToTokens` renders them in order: the provider impl, the `IsProviderFor` impl, then the provider struct (which renders to nothing when `None`).

## `EmptyStruct`

`EmptyStruct` is the provider struct, emitted only when `new` is set. `to_provider_struct` reads the shape from the impl's `Self` type: a plain name yields a unit `pub struct Name;`, while a generic provider yields a struct whose single `PhantomData` field binds every parameter — a lifetime parameter is bound as `Life<'a>` so the struct stays covariant and `'static`-friendly. Two or more parameters are grouped into a `PhantomData` tuple; a lone parameter is bound directly (`PhantomData<InCode>`, not `PhantomData<(InCode)>`) to avoid a single-element parenthesized type, and a const-only provider gets `PhantomData<()>`.

```rust
// generic provider Self type SpawnAndRun<InCode>
pub struct SpawnAndRun<InCode>(pub ::core::marker::PhantomData<InCode>);
```

## Tests

- The stage transforms are exercised by the `snapshot_cgp_provider!` snapshots and the behavioral tests indexed in the [`#[cgp_provider]` entrypoint document](../entrypoints/cgp_provider.md); `#[cgp_new_provider]`'s direct coverage is indexed in [its entrypoint document](../entrypoints/cgp_new_provider.md).
