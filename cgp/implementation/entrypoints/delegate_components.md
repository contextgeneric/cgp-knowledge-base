# `delegate_components!` — implementation

`delegate_components!` builds a context's type-level wiring table by parsing a `DelegateTable` from the macro body and lowering each mapping into a `DelegateComponent` impl plus a forwarding `IsProviderFor` impl. This document covers how that lowering works internally; for the accepted syntax and the complete expansion a user sees, read the reference document [reference/macros/delegate_components.md](../../reference/macros/delegate_components.md).

## Entry point

The macro is driven by the thin `delegate_components` function in [cgp-macro-lib/src/delegate_components.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/macros/cgp-macro-lib/src/delegate_components.rs). It parses the whole body into a single [`DelegateTable`](../asts/delegate_component.md), rejects any attributes the parser accepted (the table supports none), evaluates the table, and emits the resulting tokens:

```rust
let table: DelegateTable = parse2(body.clone())?;
table.validate_attributes()?;
let evaluated_table = table.eval()?;
Ok(evaluated_table.to_token_stream())
```

All real logic lives in `cgp-macro-core`. A malformed body fails while parsing `DelegateTable`, and an attribute on the table or any key fails in `validate_attributes` with a spanned "unsupported attribute" error rather than being silently dropped. The check recurses through mapping values, so an attribute on a key nested inside a `UseDelegate<new Inner { … }>` table is rejected too, not just one on a top-level key.

## Pipeline

The macro has two stages after parsing: attribute rejection and a single `eval`. Parsing produces the whole [`delegate_component` AST stack](../asts/delegate_component.md) — the table, its `new` keyword and optional generic list, the entries (statements plus mappings), and the keys and values inside each mapping. `eval` walks that tree once, lowering every mapping and statement into a flat list of evaluated entries and rendering each into its impl pair. The `open`/`namespace`/`for` statements and the nested-`UseDelegate` values are handled inside `eval` as part of the same walk; there is no separate preprocessing stage.

## Generated items

For every table entry the macro emits two impls in order: a `DelegateComponent` impl that records the mapping (the component key, the chosen provider as the `Delegate` type) and an `IsProviderFor` impl that forwards the provider's dependencies back through the table so a missing transitive requirement stays diagnosable. A plain `Key: Provider` mapping lowers directly:

```rust
// delegate_components! { Rectangle { AreaCalculatorComponent: RectangleArea } }
impl DelegateComponent<AreaCalculatorComponent> for Rectangle {
    type Delegate = RectangleArea;
}
impl<__Context__, __Params__>
    IsProviderFor<AreaCalculatorComponent, __Context__, __Params__> for Rectangle
where
    RectangleArea: IsProviderFor<AreaCalculatorComponent, __Context__, __Params__>,
{}
```

Both `__Context__` and `__Params__` are the reserved identifiers that appear literally in the output. When the body carries a leading `new` keyword, the macro additionally emits the target struct (`struct Rectangle;`, or a generic struct if the target carries parameters), and a nested-`UseDelegate` value lifts its inner table out into its own struct and impls, so a value like `UseDelegate<new Inner { … }>` contributes both the outer entry and a full inner table.

The `open` header and `@Component.Key` entries lower through the [`RedirectLookup`](cgp_component.md) impl that every `#[cgp_component]` already generates. The header wires each opened component to a redirect rooted at the component name in the context's own table, and each `@`-path entry stores its provider under the extended path key:

```rust
// open AreaCalculatorComponent;  →  the redirect entry
impl DelegateComponent<AreaCalculatorComponent> for MyApp {
    type Delegate = RedirectLookup<MyApp, PathCons<AreaCalculatorComponent, Nil>>;
}
// @AreaCalculatorComponent.Rectangle: RectangleArea  →  a keyed entry on the same table,
// keyed by the redirect path with a trailing wildcard, mapping to RectangleArea
```

The per-value entries are ordinary `DelegateComponent`/`IsProviderFor` pairs whose key is the redirect path type; `RedirectLookup` appends the dispatch parameter onto the path at lookup time and reads the result back.

## Behavior and corner cases

A **mapping operator** selects which value lowering applies. `:` (Normal) maps the key straight to the named provider; `->` (Direct) sets the `Delegate` to `<Value as DelegateComponent<Key>>::Delegate` and adds a `Value: DelegateComponent<Key>` bound, so the entry forwards to the value's own entry for that key; `=>` (Redirect) sets the `Delegate` to `RedirectLookup<TableType, Path>` along an `@`-path value. The [`delegate_component` AST document](../asts/delegate_component.md) describes each in full.

An **array key** `[A, B]: Provider` expands to one impl pair per bracketed key, all pointing at the same value, because the key evaluates to a vector of evaluated keys that the mapping iterates. A **per-key or per-table generic list** is merged onto every generated impl: a table-level `<'a, T>` is threaded through each impl's generics, and a key may introduce its own extra generics (`<T2> BazKey<T1, T2>`) that merge with the table's.

An **`@`-path key** carries a leading `__Wildcard__` generic and lowers the path to a prefix type ending in that wildcard, which is how a dispatch parameter slots in at lookup time. The path itself is a `PathHead`, whose three variants are the three surface forms and whose `into_paths` walk produces the cartesian product of every group with every tail: a plain `Type` segment prepends itself to each tail path; a **bracketed group** (`@app.[FooComponent, BarComponent].[u64, String]: P`) holds alternative single segments for one position and may be followed by more path; and a **braced group** (`@Component.{u32, u64}: P`, or the multi-length `@app.{A.{X, Y}, B}: P`) holds alternative whole tails and terminates the path, which is why only the braced form nests. Each segment may carry its own generics, which merge with the key's and the table's. The `=>` redirect *value*, by contrast, parses as a `UniPath` and admits no groups at all.

The `namespace`/`for` statement forms lower through a shared "for-entry" path that builds a `Namespace<…, Delegate = …>` bound rather than a direct `DelegateComponent` impl; these are the namespace machinery and are detailed in the AST document. A **`for` loop's optional `where` clause** is merged into every impl the loop generates, alongside that reconstructed bound, so a bound written on the loop constrains which keys it wires.

The **`open` statement is exactly a `=>` redirect** whose key is the opened component and whose path is that component alone: both lower to `RedirectLookup<TableType, PathCons<Component, Nil>>`, so `open C;` and `C => @C,` produce identical impls and differ only in which token the entry's span comes from.

## Error spans

Each generated impl is re-spanned onto the entry that produced it, so a compiler error about that impl points at the entry the user wrote rather than at the whole `delegate_components!` block. The impls are built with `parse_internal!`, which quasi-quotes their tokens; those tokens carry the macro invocation's `call_site` span, and the only tokens with a narrower span are the interpolated key, value, and target type. A coherence conflict (`E0119`) between two entries mapping the same key is reported on the impl header — its `impl` keyword and trait reference — which is exactly the part that starts at `call_site`, so without correction the error underlines the entire block, and two overlapping entries produce two block-wide carets that say nothing about which entry to fix.

`build_delegate_component_impl` and `build_is_provider_for_impl` fix this through `respan_impl`, which re-spans only the impl's two *boundary* tokens — its leading `impl` keyword and its trailing `{ … }` body — onto the entry's diagnostic span, and leaves everything between them alone. That is enough because the compiler derives a generated item's span, and therefore the `E0119` caret, by joining its first and last tokens (`first.to(last)`): with the whole impl at `call_site` the caret is the whole invocation, and pulling just those two ends onto the entry collapses it onto what the user wrote. The interior — the trait reference, the reserved `__Context__`/`__Params__` generics, the key, the wired provider, the target type, a per-entry generic — keeps its own spans.

Leaving the interior in place is not just an economy; it is what keeps the result usable in two ways the whole-impl re-span could not. A diagnostic about a per-entry generic still points where the user declared it — an unconstrained parameter's `E0207` lands on the `<T>` the user wrote rather than being dragged onto the key — because that `<T>` is an interior token the re-span never touches. And a type written in the block stays navigable: rust-analyzer maps a source token to its expanded counterpart purely by source range, ignoring hygiene, so a synthesized reference like `IsProviderFor` or `DelegateComponent` re-spanned onto the key would land on the key's exact range, and go-to-definition on that key would then offer every such collided construct as a candidate. Keeping the interior untouched leaves each synthesized reference at `call_site` (a range no narrower user token shares) and each user token — the wired provider, the target type — at its own span, so navigation resolves to the one right definition. The two tokens that *do* move are a keyword and a delimiter group, never references, so moving them onto the key misleads neither the compiler nor the editor. (An earlier fix re-spanned *every* token of the impl onto the entry; that put `IsProviderFor` and the target type on the key's range and broke go-to-definition, which is why the re-span is now scoped to the boundary.) The [`override_item_span`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/macros/cgp-macro-core/src/functions/override_span.rs) helper it uses re-spans a boundary token only when that token is itself synthesized, recognized by its `call_site` span. `check_components!` aims its own error the opposite way, with the unconditional `override_span` helper in the same file, because there the intent *is* to clobber a user token — one shared context type, forced onto each checked component in turn.

The diagnostic span is carried explicitly rather than read back from the generated key, because a key type may be *synthesized* and so no longer carry a useful span. This follows the [`EvaluatedCheckEntry.span`](check_components.md) pattern: `EvaluatedDelegateKey`, `EvaluatedDelegateEntry`, and the `namespace`/`for` intermediary `EvaluatedForEntry` each hold a `span` field, populated at eval time from the token the user actually wrote and threaded through to `respan_impl`. Every entry form sources its span this way, so none falls back to `call_site`: a plain `Key: Provider`, `Key -> Value`, or `Key => @path` mapping (and each element of an array key) takes the key type's own span; the `open` header takes the opened component's span; a `namespace`/`for` statement takes the namespace name or the loop mapping's key; and a nested `UseDelegate<new Inner { .. }>` table lowers through the same per-entry path, so its inner keys are spanned too.

An `@`-path key needs more than its lowered type, since that type is a `PathCons<..>` nest whose first token is a `call_site`-spanned `PathCons` (the same problem `Symbol` avoids by keeping a parse-time span so its synthesized `Chars`/`Symbol` tokens do not fall back to `call_site`). So an `@`-path sources its span from the path segments — the join of the segment spans, which widens to the whole path where the toolchain supports `Span::join` and otherwise keeps the leaf segment (the component of a namespace path, or the dispatch key of an `@Component.key` entry), so the caret lands on the segment that discriminates entries sharing a prefix.

Because the `.stderr` fixtures record the exact line and column of each caret, they double as regression tests for these spans: reverting the re-span snaps the carets back to the block and the snapshots change (see [Tests](#tests)).

## Failure modes

Some `delegate_components!` inputs are accepted by the macro but fail to compile downstream, because the macro lowers each block independently with no whole-program view. These are intended behavior rather than bugs, and their full anatomy is documented in the [error catalog](../../errors/README.md); the [Error spans](#error-spans) section below covers how each caret is aimed at the offending entry.

A **duplicate key** (the same component mapped twice — across blocks, within a block, or an `open` header colliding with a mapping) and an **overlapping generic entry** (a `<T> Wrapper<T>` table conflicting with a specific `Wrapper<u64>`) both produce the coherence error `E0119`, the [conflicting wiring](../../errors/wiring/conflicting-wiring.md) error class.

A **missing impl-side dependency** — a lazily-wired provider whose `where` clause the context cannot satisfy — is accepted here and fails only when the consumer trait is used. Its full anatomy (the `E0599` that names `Person: Greeter<Person>` while *hiding* the missing dependency, and how a `check_components!` site promotes it to a readable error) is documented as the [hidden unsatisfied-dependency](../../errors/hidden/unsatisfied-dependency.md) error class in the error catalog.

An **unconstrained per-entry generic** — a parameter that reaches the provider value but not the key — is rejected with `E0207`, the [unconstrained generic](../../errors/wiring/unconstrained-generic.md) error class.

## Known issues

The macro's parser is permissive about the body shape and surfaces most mistakes as generic `syn` parse errors rather than tailored diagnostics — for example, an `open` header written after a plain mapping fails to parse because statements must lead the block, but the error (`expected `:``) points at the unexpected token rather than explaining the ordering rule.

## Snapshots

Every `snapshot_delegate_components!` invocation across the suite is indexed here, since these snapshots all belong to this entrypoint. The basic-delegation snapshots pin the plain-table forms:

- [basic_delegation/delegate_components_macro.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/delegate_components_macro.rs) — the canonical `new`-table expansion (two entries) plus the `->` forwarding form that delegates to another table's entry.
- [basic_delegation/delegate_array_key.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/delegate_array_key.rs) — an array key expanding to one impl pair per bracketed key.
- [basic_delegation/delegate_generic_table.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/delegate_generic_table.rs) — a leading `<'a, T1: Clone>` generic list threaded onto every impl, with a key introducing its own extra generic (`<T2> BazKey<T1, T2>`).

The namespace snapshots pin the statement and `@`-path forms:

- [namespaces/open_dispatch.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/open_dispatch.rs) — the braced `open { A, B }` header opening two components at once, plus `@Component.Key` per-value entries, including a brace group sharing one provider across several keys.
- [namespaces/multi_param_open.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/multi_param_open.rs) — the braceless single-component `open Component;` form, dispatched on a multi-segment `@Component.A.B` path with one segment carrying an entry generic.
- [namespaces/namespace_basic.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/namespace_basic.rs), [namespaces/namespace_symbol_path.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/namespace_symbol_path.rs), [namespaces/namespace_type_path.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/namespace_type_path.rs) — the `namespace …;` header forwarding every lookup through a namespace trait, with bare, symbol-path, and type-path `@`-keys.
- [namespaces/namespace_multi.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/namespace_multi.rs), [namespaces/namespace_group.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/namespace_group.rs) — brace-group and array-group `@`-keys expanding to the cartesian product of segments.
- [namespaces/multi_param_namespace.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/multi_param_namespace.rs) — multi-segment namespace paths with a per-segment generic.
- [namespaces/extended_namespace_wiring.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/extended_namespace_wiring.rs) — a namespace table mixing plain and nested-group `@`-paths across several crates' components.
- [namespaces/prefix_default_namespace.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/prefix_default_namespace.rs) — a `DefaultNamespace` header with fully-qualified `@cgp.core.error.…` paths.
- [namespaces/default_impls_wiring.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/default_impls_wiring.rs) — the `for <T, Provider> in SomeTable { … }` loop form pulling entries from another lookup table.
- [namespaces/for_where_clause.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/for_where_clause.rs) — the `for <..> in .. where ..` loop with a `where` clause, pinning the clause merged onto each generated impl beside the reconstructed namespace bound.
- [namespaces/redirect_lookup.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/redirect_lookup.rs) — a `namespace` header producing the `RedirectLookup`-style blanket `DelegateComponent` impl.
- [dispatching/use_delegate_getter.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/dispatching/use_delegate_getter.rs) — the legacy `UseDelegate<new … { … }>` nested-table value, including a custom `UseDelegate2` wrapper over tuple keys.

One variant has no snapshot: a bare (non-`new`) single-entry table with a plain type target, distinct from the standalone `new` bundle that owns the canonical snapshot.

## Tests

The behavioral tests confirm the generated wiring resolves and compiles:

- [basic_delegation/delegate_new_struct.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/delegate_new_struct.rs) checks that `new` declares the table struct and the table resolves as written.
- [basic_delegation/delegate_new_array_key.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/delegate_new_array_key.rs) checks the array-key and nested-`new` forms parse and expand together.
- [basic_delegation/delegate_new_generic_struct.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/delegate_new_generic_struct.rs) checks that `<T> new MyComponents<T>` declares a generic table struct.
- [basic_delegation/delegate_nested_use_delegate.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/delegate_nested_use_delegate.rs) checks a two-level nested `UseDelegate` value builds an inline dispatch table.
- [basic_delegation/delegate_generic_nested_value.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/delegate_generic_nested_value.rs) checks a per-entry `<T>` list threads through both the outer key and the inner generated table struct.
- [basic_delegation/consumer_delegate_getter.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/consumer_delegate_getter.rs) and [basic_delegation/consumer_delegate_generic.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/consumer_delegate_generic.rs) check that a context may satisfy some components by wiring and others by a direct trait impl, and that a generic component resolves independently per type argument.

The failure cases in `cgp-macro-tests` pin the attribute rejection:

- [parser_rejections/delegate_components.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-macro-tests/tests/parser_rejections/delegate_components.rs) asserts the macro rejects an attribute on the table, on a key, and on a key nested inside a `UseDelegate<new Inner { … }>` value (the last confirms the validator recurses through mapping values rather than dropping the attribute), and that a braceless `open` header listing more than one component is rejected (the braceless form opens exactly one).

The post-codegen compile-fail cases are now `cargo-cgp` UI fixtures that pin the expansions that fail to compile. All are **acceptable** failures — deferred to the compiler by design, none a defect — and their anatomy is documented in the [error catalog](../../errors/README.md); the [Failure modes](#failure-modes) section links each to its class. `cargo-cgp` files each fixture by the *quality of the output* it renders (`acceptable/` when the tool already leads with the cause, `usability/` when the cause is present but buried), which is why the unconstrained-generic case below sits under `usability/` even though it is not a defect:

- [`acceptable/wiring/duplicate-keys/duplicate_key.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/wiring/duplicate-keys/duplicate_key.rs) — two blocks mapping the same key expand to conflicting `DelegateComponent` impls (`E0119`).
- [`acceptable/wiring/duplicate-keys/duplicate_key_same_block.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/wiring/duplicate-keys/duplicate_key_same_block.rs) — the same conflict from two entries in one block; its `.rust.stderr` pins the per-entry [error spans](#error-spans), each caret landing on its own `GreeterComponent` key rather than the whole block.
- [`acceptable/wiring/namespace-paths/delegate_duplicate_path_key.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/wiring/namespace-paths/delegate_duplicate_path_key.rs) — the `@`-path analogue: two identical `@cgp.core.error.ErrorTypeProviderComponent` entries under a `namespace` header conflict, and its `.rust.stderr` pins the [error span](#error-spans) landing on the duplicated path leaf rather than the whole block, even though the key lowers to a synthesized `PathCons<..>` type.
- [`acceptable/wiring/duplicate-keys/duplicate_open_key.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/wiring/duplicate-keys/duplicate_open_key.rs) — an `open` header colliding with an explicit mapping for the same component; its `.rust.stderr` pins the [error span](#error-spans) of the `open`-header entry, whose span comes from the opened component (a source distinct from the plain key path).
- [`acceptable/wiring/duplicate-keys/overlapping_generic.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/wiring/duplicate-keys/overlapping_generic.rs) — a generic `<T> Wrapper<T>` entry overlaps a specific `Wrapper<u64>` entry at the same key (`E0119`).
- [`acceptable/use-site/missing_dependency.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/use-site/missing_dependency.rs) — a lazily-wired provider whose `Self: HasName` dependency the context does not satisfy; the unmet bound surfaces at the call site (`E0599`). Its anatomy is the [hidden unsatisfied-dependency](../../errors/hidden/unsatisfied-dependency.md) error class.
- [`acceptable/use-site/ordinary_bound_unsatisfied.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/use-site/ordinary_bound_unsatisfied.rs) — the same hidden `E0599` where the suppressed dependency is an *ordinary* trait bound (`Scalar: Eq`, unmet by a wired `f64`) rather than a `HasField`, called rather than checked. Same [hidden unsatisfied-dependency](../../errors/hidden/unsatisfied-dependency.md) class; its surfaced counterpart is the [unsatisfied ordinary trait bound](../../errors/checks/ordinary-trait-bound.md) class.
- [`usability/wiring/constraints/unconstrained_generic.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/usability/wiring/constraints/unconstrained_generic.rs) — a per-entry generic that appears only in the value (`<T> GreeterComponent: GreetWith<T>`) lowers to an impl with an unconstrained `T` (`E0207`), which the compiler rejects as it would a hand-written impl.
