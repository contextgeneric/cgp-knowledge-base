# `#[derive(CgpData)]` — implementation

`#[derive(CgpData)]` is the umbrella extensible-data derive: applied to a struct it emits the full record machinery, applied to an enum the full variant machinery, dispatching on shape and reusing the same codegen as the shape-specific `#[derive(CgpRecord)]` and `#[derive(CgpVariant)]`. This document covers how that composition works; for the accepted syntax and the full expansion, read the reference document [reference/derives/derive_cgp_data.md](../../reference/derives/derive_cgp_data.md).

## Entry point

The macro is driven by the `derive_cgp_data` function in [cgp-macro-lib/src/cgp_data.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/macros/cgp-macro-lib/src/cgp_data.rs). It parses the input into an `ItemCgpData` and calls `to_items`:

```rust
let data: ItemCgpData = parse2(body)?;
let items = data.to_items()?;
```

`ItemCgpData` is an enum of `Record(ItemCgpRecord)` or `Variant(ItemCgpVariant)`; its `Parse` impl routes a `struct` to the record arm and an `enum` to the variant arm, rejecting anything else with "expect body to be either a struct or enum". Its `to_items` forwards to the wrapped type's `to_items`, so `CgpData` on a struct emits exactly what `#[derive(CgpRecord)]` emits and `CgpData` on an enum exactly what `#[derive(CgpVariant)]` emits — the two shape-specific derives are `CgpData` restricted to one shape. See the [`cgp_data` AST stack](../asts/cgp_data.md) for those types.

## Pipeline

There is no multi-stage transform; the composition happens inside the two `to_items` methods.

- **`ItemCgpRecord::to_items`** (the struct path) concatenates three slices in order: the per-field `HasField`/`HasFieldMut` getters (the [`#[derive(HasField)]`](derive_has_field.md) output), the five representation impls (the [`#[derive(HasFields)]`](derive_has_fields.md) output), and the incremental builder items (the [`#[derive(BuildField)]`](derive_build_field.md) output).
- **`ItemCgpVariant::to_items`** (the enum path) concatenates three slices in order: the five representation impls over a sum (the enum path of [`#[derive(HasFields)]`](derive_has_fields.md)), the per-variant `FromVariant` constructors (the [`#[derive(FromVariant)]`](derive_from_variant.md) output), and the incremental extractor items (the [`#[derive(ExtractField)]`](derive_extract_field.md) output).

Each slice is documented in the entrypoint linked beside it; because `CgpData` reuses those exact methods, this document does not repeat the item shapes and points to them instead.

## Generated items

For a struct, the fixed emission order is: the `HasField`/`HasFieldMut` getters per field, then `HasFields`, `HasFieldsRef`, `FromFields`, `ToFields`, `ToFieldsRef`, then the builder block — the `__Partial{Name}` struct, `HasBuilder`, `IntoBuilder`, `PartialData`, `FinalizeBuild`, then the per-field `UpdateField` and `HasField` impls. For an enum: `HasFields`, `HasFieldsRef`, `FromFields`, `ToFields`, `ToFieldsRef`, then one `FromVariant` per variant, then the extractor block — the `__Partial{Name}` and `__PartialRef{Name}` enums, `PartialData` for each, `HasExtractor`/`HasExtractorRef`/`HasExtractorMut`, `FinalizeExtract` for each, then the per-variant `ExtractField` impls for both.

The two views this composes are the *representation* view (the `HasFields` product or sum, convertible with `FromFields`/`ToFields`) and the *incremental* view (the `__Partial…` companion type that tracks per-field presence or per-variant possibility in its type parameters). The reserved companion names are `__Partial{Name}` and, for the borrowed extractor, `__PartialRef{Name}`. The full item shapes live in the building-block entrypoint documents linked above.

## Behavior and corner cases

Field tagging follows the same rule as the whole family: a named struct field or an enum variant is keyed by [`Symbol!`](../../reference/macros/symbol.md), and a tuple-struct field by [`Index<N>`](../../reference/types/index.md), so a tuple-struct record exposes `Field<Index<0>, _>` entries and `UpdateField<Index<0>, _>` impls rather than symbol tags. The type's generic parameters and `where` clause are threaded onto every generated impl and onto the `__Partial…` companion types.

The shape-specific corner cases are inherited from the building blocks rather than introduced here: a single-field tuple struct is special-cased in the `HasFields` product (see [`derive_has_fields`](derive_has_fields.md)), and an enum whose variants are not each single-unnamed-field tuple variants fails in the extractor and `FromVariant` codegen (see [`derive_extract_field`](derive_extract_field.md) and [`derive_from_variant`](derive_from_variant.md)). `CgpData` on such an enum therefore fails the same way, because it runs the same helpers.

Error spans are inherited the same way. Because `CgpData` runs exactly the slice helpers, each generated impl is already re-spanned onto the token it derives from — a per-field impl onto its field, a per-variant impl onto its variant, and a whole-type impl onto the struct or enum name — so a coherence conflict points at that token rather than at the whole `#[derive(CgpData)]`. The mechanism is documented under [`#[derive(HasField)]`](derive_has_field.md#error-spans) and repeated in each slice's Error spans section.

## Known issues

**Seven variant names are reserved on an enum, inherited from the slices this derive composes.** Because the generated impls name their associated types through `Self::…`, a variant called `Fields` or `FieldsRef` (from [`derive_has_fields`](derive_has_fields.md#known-issues)), or `Value`, `Remainder`, `Extractor`, `ExtractorRef`, or `ExtractorMut` (from [`derive_extract_field`](derive_extract_field.md#known-issues) and [`derive_from_variant`](derive_from_variant.md#known-issues)), makes that path ambiguous and the expansion is rejected with `ambiguous associated item`, headlined at the derive attribute. Whether a note also names the variant depends on the slice: the representation and constructor impls target the user's enum and so point at the real variant, while the extractor's target the generated companions and point back at the derive. The fix belongs in each slice's codegen — a fully qualified projection in place of `Self::…` — rather than here, since this derive introduces no paths of its own. A struct's field names are unaffected.

## Snapshots

Every `snapshot_derive_cgp_data!` invocation across the suite is indexed here, since these snapshots all belong to this entrypoint. The record expansion is owned by the `extensible_records` target and the variant expansion by `extensible_variants`:

- [extensible_records/record_derive.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_records/record_derive.rs) — the canonical named-field record expansion (getters, representation, builder).
- [extensible_records/person_record.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_records/person_record.rs) — multi-character field names, pinning the full `Symbol<N, Chars<…>>` list with its length prefix.
- [extensible_records/tuple_record.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_records/tuple_record.rs) — a tuple struct, the whole record list keyed by `Index<N>`.
- [extensible_records/generic_record.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_records/generic_record.rs) — a generic record with a `where` clause threaded through every impl.
- [extensible_records/optional_builder.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_records/optional_builder.rs) — the record expansion under the optional-builder runtime path.
- [extensible_records/point_cast.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_records/point_cast.rs) — the record expansion behind a structural record cast with `build_with_default`.
- [extensible_records/record_empty.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_records/record_empty.rs) — a fieldless struct, the record-side degenerate case: `Fields` = `Nil`, a parameterless `__Partial…` struct that `HasBuilder`, `IntoBuilder`, and `FinalizeBuild` all name, and no per-field impls.
- [extensible_variants/derive_cgp_data.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_variants/derive_cgp_data.rs) — the canonical concrete-enum variant expansion (representation, `FromVariant`, extractor).
- [extensible_variants/derive_cgp_data_generic.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_variants/derive_cgp_data_generic.rs) — a generic enum, generics lifted onto the `__Partial*` extractor enums, with upcast/downcast.
- [extensible_variants/derive_cgp_data_shape.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_variants/derive_cgp_data_shape.rs) — an enum with struct payloads and multi-character variant names.
- [extensible_variants/derive_cgp_data_empty.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_variants/derive_cgp_data_empty.rs) — a variantless enum, the degenerate special case: bare `__Partial*` enums with no parameters and `match *self {}` in the borrowed accessors.

## Tests

The snapshot tests above also carry runtime assertions that exercise the composed machinery:

- `person_record.rs` builds an `Employee` from a `Person` via the builder.
- `optional_builder.rs` drives the optional builder (`set`/`finalize_optional`/`finalize_with_default`).
- `point_cast.rs` casts a smaller record up into a larger one.
- The `derive_cgp_data*` variant snapshots run the extractor and the upcast/downcast casts.

Standalone behavioral tests (no snapshot, since the expansion shape is already pinned above) cover the corner cases the snapshots do not:

- [extensible_records/record_lifetime.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_records/record_lifetime.rs) — the builder path on a struct with a lifetime parameter, threading `'a` through the `__Partial…` companion and every builder impl (the record-side counterpart of the enum lifetime test below).
- [extensible_variants/derive_cgp_data_lifetime.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_variants/derive_cgp_data_lifetime.rs) — the extractor path on an enum whose own lifetime is named `'a`, confirming the reserved `'__a__` borrow lifetime does not collide.
- [record_build_from.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_records/record_build_from.rs), [record_build_with_handlers.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_records/record_build_with_handlers.rs), [shape_dispatch.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_variants/shape_dispatch.rs), [shape_dispatch_ref.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_variants/shape_dispatch_ref.rs), and [variant_dispatch.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_variants/variant_dispatch.rs) exercise the builder and dispatch behaviors on `CgpData` types.

The umbrella's own rejection path is pinned in [cgp-macro-tests/parser_rejections/derive_cgp_data.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-macro-tests/tests/parser_rejections/derive_cgp_data.rs): the shape dispatch refuses an item that is neither a struct nor an enum (a union), and the enum path propagates the single-unnamed-field variant restriction it shares with [`#[derive(CgpVariant)]`](derive_cgp_variant.md) and [`#[derive(FromVariant)]`](derive_from_variant.md).
