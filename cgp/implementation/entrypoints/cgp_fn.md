# `#[cgp_fn]` — implementation

`#[cgp_fn]` turns one plain Rust function into a single-implementation capability by deriving a trait carrying the method and a blanket impl of that trait over a generic context, pulling every `#[implicit]` argument out of the signature and reading it from the context's fields. This document covers how that works internally; for the accepted syntax and the complete expansion a user sees, read the reference document [reference/macros/cgp_fn.md](../../reference/macros/cgp_fn.md).

## Entry point

The macro is driven by the thin `cgp_fn` function in [cgp-macro-lib/src/cgp_fn.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/macros/cgp-macro-lib/src/cgp_fn.rs), which parses the attribute into an optional trait-name `Ident` and the item into a `syn::ItemFn`, then runs the two-stage pipeline and emits the result.

```rust
let item_cgp_fn = ItemCgpFn { ident, item_fn };
let items = item_cgp_fn.preprocess()?.to_items()?;
```

Two failures surface at the boundary: applying the macro to a non-function item fails at `parse2::<ItemFn>`, and a malformed attribute (anything other than a single optional identifier) fails at `parse2::<Option<Ident>>`. All real logic lives in `cgp-macro-core`.

## Pipeline

The macro moves through two stages, each a method on the AST type the previous one produced; the [`cgp_fn` AST stack](../asts/cgp_fn.md) documents those types in full.

- **preprocess** normalizes the function into the pieces the emit stage needs: it derives the trait name (the attribute identifier, or the function name converted to PascalCase), extracts the `#[implicit]` arguments out of the signature and prepends their field-reading bindings to the body, splits the companion attributes (`#[uses]`, `#[extend]`, `#[use_type]`, and the rest) out of the raw attribute list, and moves the function's generics aside.
- **to_items** renders the two output items — the trait carrying the method signature, then the blanket impl over `__Context__` carrying the body.

## Generated items

`#[cgp_fn]` emits exactly two items in a fixed order: the trait with the method, and the blanket impl of that trait for the reserved context type `__Context__`. There is no provider struct, no component marker, and no wiring — the method becomes available on every context that satisfies the impl's `where` clause.

The interesting transform is what happens to an `#[implicit]` argument. The argument is removed from the method signature entirely, its field is required as a `HasField` bound on the impl, and a `let` binding that reads the field is spliced onto the front of the body so the original body sees the name unchanged:

```rust
// input
#[cgp_fn]
pub fn greet(&self, #[implicit] name: &str) {
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
}

// derived trait — the implicit argument is gone from the signature
pub trait Greet {
    fn greet(&self);
}

// derived blanket impl — the field is a bound, the binding is prepended
impl<__Context__> Greet for __Context__
where
    Self: HasField<Symbol!("name"), Value = String>,
{
    fn greet(&self) {
        let name: &str = self.get_field(PhantomData::<Symbol!("name")>).as_str();
        println!("Hello, {}!", name);
    }
}
```

The conversion applied to each binding is chosen by the argument's type, following the same field-mode rules the getter macros use: a `&str` argument reads a `String` field and appends `.as_str()`, an owned value — a path type, tuple, or array — appends `.clone()`, an `Option<&T>` reads an `Option<T>` field and appends `.as_ref()`, an `Option<&str>` reads an `Option<String>` field and appends `.as_deref()`, an `&[T]` reads an `AsRef<[T]>` field and appends `.as_ref()`, and a plain `&T` is taken by reference with no conversion. Each reference mode has a mutable mirror selected by a `&mut` in the argument's type: a `&mut T` reads through `HasFieldMut`/`get_field_mut`; a `&mut [T]` reads an `AsMut<[T]>` field and appends `.as_mut()`; an `Option<&mut T>` reads an `Option<T>` field and appends `.as_mut()`; an `Option<&mut str>` appends `.as_deref_mut()`. Every mutable read requires a `&mut self` receiver, while every immutable argument reads through `HasField`/`get_field` regardless of the receiver. The slice and option modes are keyed off the *argument's own* reference, not the receiver's, so an immutable `&[T]` keeps its shared `AsRef<[T]>` bound even under a `&mut self` receiver rather than being forced mutable. These modes are shared with `#[cgp_auto_getter]` and `#[cgp_getter]` through the [field-parsing helpers](../asts/cgp_getter.md); the difference is only where the read lands — a prepended `let` in the body here, a getter-method body there.

## Behavior and corner cases

**Generic parameters and the `where` clause split deliberately.** Every generic parameter in the function's `<...>` list is copied onto both the generated trait and the impl, while the function's own `where` clause is treated as an impl-side dependency and lands only on the impl, hidden from the trait interface. The implicit `HasField` bounds are always appended last, after any attribute-contributed predicates, so the impl's `where` clause reads user-declared bounds first and field bounds last.

**The companion attributes are layered into the same two items.** `#[uses(Trait)]` and `#[extend(Trait)]` each push a `Self: Trait` predicate onto the impl; `#[extend(Trait)]` additionally makes `Trait` a supertrait of the generated trait, `#[extend_where(...)]` adds predicates to the trait's own `where` clause, `#[impl_generics(...)]` inserts parameters into the impl generics only, and `#[use_type]`/`#[use_provider]` transform the trait and impl as documented on their own pages. Any attribute the parser does not recognize (for example `#[async_trait]` or `#[allow(...)]`) is preserved as a raw attribute and re-attached to both the trait and the impl.

**The visibility is moved, not copied.** `preprocess` takes the function's visibility off the inner `ItemFn` and re-applies it to the generated trait, so the emitted method inside the trait is always inherited-visibility while the trait itself carries the `pub` the user wrote.

**A malformed `#[implicit]` attribute is rejected at extraction.** `#[implicit]` is recognized only as a bare `Meta::Path`; the extraction pass additionally checks for an `implicit`-named attribute in any other form (`#[implicit(...)]` or `#[implicit = ...]`) and returns a spanned error, rather than leaving the stray attribute on the parameter to surface downstream as an obscure `cannot find attribute 'implicit'` error.

**A mutable implicit argument must be the only implicit argument.** The `field_mut` of each argument follows the argument's own type — set from a `&mut` in the type, whether the outer reference of a `&mut T`/`&mut [T]` or the inner reference of an `Option<&mut T>`, not from the receiver — so a mutable argument reads through `get_field_mut` while every immutable argument reads through `get_field`, even under a `&mut self` receiver. Because a `get_field_mut` read borrows the whole context exclusively for the rest of the body, a mutable implicit cannot coexist with any other implicit read; extraction rejects the combination (`has_mutable && count > 1`) rather than emit a blanket impl that fails to borrow-check. Any number of purely immutable implicits, by contrast, are shared borrows and combine freely. A mutable argument additionally requires the `&mut self` receiver (checked in `parse_field_type`), and a `mut` *pattern* on any implicit argument is rejected outright. These checks are enforced during implicit-argument extraction.

## Failure modes

One acceptable failure follows directly from the generics split above, and it is the boundary that decides whether a type dependency may stay an `#[impl_generics]` parameter at all. Because `#[impl_generics(...)]` inserts its parameters into the *impl* generics only, a parameter it declares is not in scope in the generated trait — so a signature that names one refers to nothing, and the compiler rejects the generated trait:

```rust
#[cgp_fn]
#[impl_generics(Db: Database)]
pub fn fetch_row(&self, #[implicit] database: &Pool<Db>) -> Db::Row { todo!() }
```

The `&Pool<Db>` annotation is fine, since that parameter is stripped from the signature and becomes a `HasField` bound on the impl where `Db` *is* in scope; the `Db::Row` return type is not, because the return type stays on the trait. The macro cannot catch this earlier without deciding for the author which of the two they meant — promoting the type to an abstract type, or keeping it out of the signature — so it lowers faithfully and defers. The observable diagnostic is the [out-of-scope generated name](../../errors/lowering/out-of-scope-generated-name.md) class (`E0433`), pinned by [`acceptable/lowering/impl_generics_in_signature.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/lowering/impl_generics_in_signature.rs); the prescriptive side — when to climb from an inferred parameter to an abstract type — is [naming a type dependency](../../guides/naming-a-type-dependency.md). Note that an *abstract* type has no such restriction: [`#[use_type]`](../../reference/attributes/use_type.md) adds its bound to the generated trait as well as the impl and rewrites the alias in the trait's own signatures, which is exactly why promoting the type is the fix.

## Known issues

`#[cgp_fn]` does not support generics on the desugared *method* itself — generic parameters are only ever lifted onto the trait and impl. A method-level generic is silently treated as a trait/impl generic rather than rejected, which is the intended limitation rather than a bug: method-level generics are considered an advanced case better written as an explicit blanket impl or a [`#[cgp_component]`](../../reference/macros/cgp_component.md) provider.

- [implicit_arguments/cgp_fn_mut_self_immutable.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/implicit_arguments/cgp_fn_mut_self_immutable.rs) — a `&mut self` receiver with two *immutable* implicit arguments, showing they read through `HasField`/`get_field` (the access mode follows the argument, not the receiver) and that several immutable implicits may share a `&mut self` receiver.
- [implicit_arguments/cgp_fn_slice.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/implicit_arguments/cgp_fn_slice.rs) — an immutable `&[u8]` implicit under a `&mut self` receiver, keeping its `Value: AsRef<[u8]> + 'static` bound and `.as_ref()` read because the slice mode follows the argument's own reference, not the receiver's; also mixes an implicit with a plain explicit argument.
- [implicit_arguments/cgp_fn_mut_slice.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/implicit_arguments/cgp_fn_mut_slice.rs) — a mutable `&mut [u8]` implicit, reading through `HasFieldMut` with a `Value: AsMut<[u8]> + 'static` bound and a `get_field_mut(...).as_mut()` read, the mutable mirror of the shared-slice case.
- [implicit_arguments/cgp_fn_option_mut.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/implicit_arguments/cgp_fn_option_mut.rs) — a mutable `Option<&mut u8>` implicit, reading an `Option<u8>` field through `HasFieldMut` with a `get_field_mut(...).as_mut()` read that yields `Option<&mut u8>`.

- [async_and_send/cgp_fn_async.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/async_and_send/cgp_fn_async.rs) — the canonical async expansion, an `async fn` combined with `#[async_trait]`.
- [generic_components/fn_generic_param.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/generic_components/fn_generic_param.rs) — a function generic over a type parameter, showing the parameter moved onto both trait and impl.
- [generic_components/fn_impl_generics.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/generic_components/fn_impl_generics.rs) — `#[impl_generics(...)]` adding a generic parameter to the impl only, not the trait.
- [impl_side_dependencies/fn_extend.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/impl_side_dependencies/fn_extend.rs) — `#[extend(...)]` adding a supertrait bound to the generated trait.

- [abstract_types/use_type_fn_alias.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/abstract_types/use_type_fn_alias.rs), [use_type_fn_equality.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/abstract_types/use_type_fn_equality.rs), [use_type_fn_extend.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/abstract_types/use_type_fn_extend.rs), [use_type_fn_foreign.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/abstract_types/use_type_fn_foreign.rs), [use_type_fn_foreign_equality.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/abstract_types/use_type_fn_foreign_equality.rs), [use_type_fn_nested_foreign.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/abstract_types/use_type_fn_nested_foreign.rs), [use_type_fn_deep_foreign.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/abstract_types/use_type_fn_deep_foreign.rs), [use_type_fn_equality_cross_trait.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/abstract_types/use_type_fn_equality_cross_trait.rs), [use_type_fn_foreign_equality_cross_trait.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/abstract_types/use_type_fn_foreign_equality_cross_trait.rs) — the `#[use_type]` variants (local alias, type-equality bound, `#[extend]` form, foreign generic parameter, a three-hop foreign chain, and their combinations). The `#[extend_where(...)]` attribute's effect on the trait's own `where` clause is pinned by [use_type_fn_nested_foreign.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/abstract_types/use_type_fn_nested_foreign.rs), where it adds a `Scalar: Copy` bound (rewritten to the two-hop path) alongside the `#[use_type]` imports.

## Tests

Because `#[cgp_fn]` emits a blanket impl, its snapshot tests double as behavioral checks — the snapshot file also derives a concrete context and asserts it implements the generated trait, so a compile of the file is itself the wiring check. The runtime assertions worth calling out:

- [implicit_arguments/cgp_fn_greet.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/implicit_arguments/cgp_fn_greet.rs) proves any context with a `name: String` field implements the generated `Greet` trait via a `CheckPerson` bound.
- [implicit_arguments/cgp_fn_calling_fn.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/implicit_arguments/cgp_fn_calling_fn.rs) confirms one capability calling another resolves through both blanket impls at run time.
- [impl_side_dependencies/fn_uses.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/impl_side_dependencies/fn_uses.rs) and [impl_side_dependencies/fn_extend.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/impl_side_dependencies/fn_extend.rs) exercise the two ways of stating a dependency and confirm the resulting bounds are satisfiable.

The failure cases pin the inputs `#[cgp_fn]` refuses during expansion, each asserting the entrypoint returns `Err`:

- [parser_rejections/cgp_fn.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-macro-tests/tests/parser_rejections/cgp_fn.rs) covers an implicit argument on a function with no `self` receiver, a `mut` binding pattern on an implicit argument, a `&mut` implicit argument that is not the sole implicit (which would borrow the context mutably and again at once), a malformed `#[implicit]` attribute carrying arguments (`#[implicit(...)]` or `#[implicit = ...]`), and the two mutable-reference forms under a `&self` receiver — a `&mut [T]` slice and an `Option<&mut T>` — each of which reads through `get_field_mut` and so requires `&mut self`.
