# `#[cgp_component]` — implementation

`#[cgp_component]` turns one consumer trait into a full component by parsing the trait, deriving the provider trait and the blanket impls that route between the two sides, and emitting the standard provider impls. This document covers how that works internally; for the accepted syntax and the complete expansion a user sees, read the reference document [reference/macros/cgp_component.md](../../reference/macros/cgp_component.md).

## Entry point

The macro is driven by the thin `cgp_component` function in [cgp-macro-lib/src/cgp_component.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/macros/cgp-macro-lib/src/cgp_component.rs), which follows the canonical entry-point shape: it parses the attribute into a `CgpComponentArgs` and the item into a `syn::ItemTrait`, then runs the pipeline and emits the result.

```rust
let item_cgp_component = ItemCgpComponent { args, item_trait };
let derived = item_cgp_component.preprocess()?.eval()?.to_items()?;
```

All real logic lives in `cgp-macro-core`. Two failures surface here: a malformed attribute is rejected while parsing `CgpComponentArgs` (the argument grammar is enforced by its `Parse` impl), and applying the macro to a non-trait item fails at `syn::parse2::<ItemTrait>`.

## Pipeline

The macro moves through three stages, each a method on the AST type the previous one produced; the [`cgp_component` AST stack](../asts/cgp_component.md) documents those types in full.

- **preprocess** strips the CGP modifier attributes (`#[derive_delegate]`, `#[prefix]`, and the rest) off the trait, separating them from the plain trait the later stages transform.
- **eval** is the core derivation: it builds the provider trait, the consumer and provider blanket impls, and the component marker struct.
- **to_items** renders everything into the final `Vec<syn::Item>`, appending the standard provider impls (`UseContext`, `RedirectLookup`, and one `UseDelegate` or prefix impl per modifier attribute).

## Generated items

The macro emits five core items in a fixed order — consumer trait, consumer blanket impl, provider trait, provider blanket impl, component struct — followed by the standard provider impls. The order is what the canonical snapshot pins, so it is a contract rather than an incidental detail.

The interesting work is deriving the provider trait from the consumer trait: the original `Self` becomes an explicit leading context parameter, `self`/`Self` in every signature are rewritten to the context (via the `replace_self` visitors), and the trait's sole supertrait becomes an [`IsProviderFor`](../../reference/traits/is_provider_for.md) bound that captures the component and its parameters. A method that took `&self` ends up taking the context by value-name:

```rust
// consumer trait
pub trait CanCalculateArea {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

// derived provider trait
pub trait AreaCalculator<__Context__>:
    IsProviderFor<AreaCalculatorComponent, __Context__, ()>
{
    fn area(__context__: &__Context__) -> f64;
}
```

The two blanket impls are the routing machinery and are forwarding shells: the consumer impl makes any context that implements the provider trait for itself gain the consumer trait, and the provider impl lets any provider that delegates the component (via [`DelegateComponent`](../../reference/traits/delegate_component.md)) inherit the provider trait from its delegate. Both forward each method body to the chosen type through the shared [delegated-impl helpers](../functions/derive/delegated_impls.md), which is why their bodies all read as `<delegate>::method(context, …)`. The `UseContext` and `RedirectLookup` provider impls are two more forwarding shells over the same helpers — one routing back through the context's own consumer impl, the other along a namespace lookup path.

## Behavior and corner cases

A **supertrait** on the consumer trait is not kept as a supertrait on the provider trait; it is lowered to a bound on the context, and the same context bound is threaded onto every generated impl. So `pub trait CanGreet: HasName` produces:

```rust
pub trait Greeter<__Context__>: IsProviderFor<GreeterComponent, __Context__, ()>
where
    __Context__: HasName,
{ /* … */ }
```

A **default method body** is preserved into the provider trait, because the provider trait is a clone of the consumer trait with only `self`/`Self` rewritten. This is what lets an empty `#[cgp_impl]` provider inherit the default and satisfy the component with no method of its own.

**Generic parameters** on the component are appended after the context in the provider trait and collected into the `IsProviderFor` params tuple. A lifetime stays ahead of the context (lifetimes must precede type parameters) and is lifted into `Life<'a>` in that tuple, so `HasReference<'a, T>` yields `IsProviderFor<…, (Life<'a>, T)>`. Only *type* parameters, not lifetimes or const parameters, extend the `RedirectLookup` lookup path.

A **const generic parameter** on the component is rejected with a spanned `syn::Error` while building the params tuple, since a const value has no representation in a tuple of types and cannot key CGP's type-based wiring (see [parse_is_provider_params](../functions/parse/is_provider_params.md)). This is the idiomatic way to reject it rather than emitting a provider trait that uses the const parameter in type position and fails to compile. A const *item* on the trait (`const CONSTANT: u64;`) is unaffected — that is an associated const, not a generic parameter, and is provided by a const-generic provider struct.

The **reserved identifiers** appear literally in the output: the context parameter is `__Context__` (unless the `context` key overrides it), the provider parameter is `__Provider__`, and the `RedirectLookup` impl introduces `__Components__` and `__Path__`. These names are chosen so they never clash with a user's own type parameters.

The **marker struct's name span** is the provider identifier's span, not `Span::call_site()`. When the component name is not given explicitly, `CgpComponentArgs` derives it as `{Provider}Component` and spans that identifier on the provider identifier the user wrote in `#[cgp_component(Provider)]`. A `call_site` span would instead cover the whole `#[cgp_component(..)]` attribute, so the generated `struct {Provider}Component` would report its definition on a range that also contains the `cgp_component` macro path — and rust-analyzer go-to-definition on a delegate key naming the component would then offer both the component and the macro as targets. That misdirection appears only when navigating from another crate, where the editor relies on the recorded definition span rather than a live expansion; deriving the span from the provider identifier keeps the definition on a single user token, mirroring `derive_check_trait_ident`. See the [Spans note](../README.md#spans-aim-generated-items-at-the-token-the-user-wrote) for why span placement serves the editor as well as the compiler.

## Failure modes

A **name clash on the derived marker** — a module that declares its own `GreeterComponent` alongside a `#[cgp_component(Greeter)]` that derives the same marker — defines the name twice and fails with `E0428`, the [conflicting wiring](../../errors/wiring/conflicting-wiring.md) error class. What this document pins is the **span**: the `E0428` "previous definition here" note lands on the `Greeter` provider name inside `#[cgp_component(..)]`, not on the whole attribute, per the marker-span behavior above. The `cargo-cgp` UI fixture [`acceptable/wiring/duplicate-keys/duplicate_component_name.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/wiring/duplicate-keys/duplicate_component_name.rs) is the regression test for that span, since a regression to `call_site` would move the note onto the attribute.

## Known issues

The namespace impl a `#[prefix]` attribute adds carries the macro `call_site` span. `PrefixAttribute::to_namespace_impl` builds it with `parse_internal!` and does not re-span the result, unlike the `#[default_impl]` registration (`override_item_span` onto its key) and the `delegate_components!` entries (`respan_impl`). Two `#[prefix]` attributes naming the same namespace therefore report their `E0119` with both carets on the `#[cgp_component]` attribute, and the message does not say which registration is the duplicate. Re-spanning the impl onto the attribute's path token would move the carets to the two `#[prefix]` lines; see [asts/attributes/prefix.md](../asts/attributes/prefix.md#known-issues).

## Snapshots

Every `snapshot_cgp_component!` invocation across the suite is indexed here, since these snapshots all belong to this entrypoint:

- [basic_delegation/component_macro.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/component_macro.rs) — the canonical plain expansion (one method, no parameters).
- [basic_delegation/default_methods.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/default_methods.rs) — a supertrait lowered to a context `where`-bound plus a default method body copied into the provider trait.
- [generic_components/component_type_param.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/generic_components/component_type_param.rs) — a single type parameter, appended after `__Context__`, placed in the params tuple as `(Shape)`, and extending the `RedirectLookup` path via `ConcatPath<PathCons<Shape, Nil>>`, with no lifetime present.
- [generic_components/component_lifetime.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/generic_components/component_lifetime.rs) — a lifetime kept ahead of `__Context__`, lifted to `Life<'a>`, with a type parameter extending the `RedirectLookup` path via `ConcatPath`.
- [namespaces/namespace_basic.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/namespace_basic.rs), [namespaces/namespace_symbol_path.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/namespace_symbol_path.rs), [namespaces/namespace_type_path.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/namespace_type_path.rs), [namespaces/namespace_multi.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/namespace_multi.rs), [namespaces/redirect_lookup.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/redirect_lookup.rs), [namespaces/default_impls.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/default_impls.rs), [namespaces/prefix_default_namespace.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/prefix_default_namespace.rs) — the namespace and prefix-impl variants.

One variant has no snapshot yet: the `UseDelegate` impl a `#[derive_delegate]` attribute adds to a bare component, exercised through the error and handler families instead.

## Tests

The behavioral tests confirm the generated wiring works:

- [basic_delegation/default_methods.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/default_methods.rs) checks at run time that an empty provider impl inherits the default bodies and `App.greet()` returns the expected string.
- [generic_components/component_type_param.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/generic_components/component_type_param.rs) wires a single-type-parameter component to one provider, passes `check_components!` for a concrete type argument, and computes an area at run time.
- [generic_components/component_lifetime.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/generic_components/component_lifetime.rs) wires the lifetime-carrying component and passes `check_components!`.
- [cgp-macro-tests/tests/parser_rejections/cgp_component.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-macro-tests/tests/parser_rejections/cgp_component.rs) asserts the macro rejects a non-trait item and a trait carrying a const generic parameter.
- The `cargo-cgp` UI fixture [`acceptable/wiring/duplicate-keys/duplicate_component_name.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/wiring/duplicate-keys/duplicate_component_name.rs) pins that the derived marker's `E0428` "previous definition" note falls on the provider name rather than the whole attribute — a regression test for the marker-name span (see [Failure modes](#failure-modes)). Its error class is [conflicting wiring](../../errors/wiring/conflicting-wiring.md).
