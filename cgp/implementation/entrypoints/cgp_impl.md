# `#[cgp_impl]` — implementation

`#[cgp_impl]` lets a provider be written in consumer-trait clothing — an `impl Trait for Context` block that keeps `self`/`Self` — and lowers it into the provider-trait form that CGP requires, then hands that form to the same machinery [`#[cgp_provider]`](cgp_provider.md) drives. This document covers how the lowering works internally; for the accepted syntax and the full before/after expansion, read the reference document [reference/macros/cgp_impl.md](../../reference/macros/cgp_impl.md).

## Entry point

The macro is driven by the `cgp_impl` function in [cgp-macro-lib/src/cgp_impl.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/macros/cgp-macro-lib/src/cgp_impl.rs). It parses the attribute into an `ImplArgs` (the optional `new` keyword, the provider type, and an optional `: ComponentType` override) and the item into a `syn::ItemImpl`, then runs the two-step lowering and emits the result:

```rust
let item_cgp_impl = ItemCgpImpl { args, item_impl };
let lowered = item_cgp_impl.lower()?;
let bare_impls = lowered.lower()?;
```

The first `lower` produces a `LoweredCgpImpl`; the second turns that into either a raw provider impl (fed through `#[cgp_provider]`) or an untouched consumer impl. The entry function emits `bare_impls` followed by any `default_impls` the block's `#[default_impl]` attributes generated. A malformed attribute is rejected while parsing `ImplArgs`, and applying the macro to a non-`impl` item fails at `syn::parse2::<ItemImpl>`.

## Pipeline

The macro moves through two lowering stages, each a method on the AST type the previous one produced; the [`cgp_impl` AST stack](../asts/cgp_impl.md) documents those types in full.

- **`ItemCgpImpl::lower`** processes the companion attributes and normalizes the impl header. It strips the CGP modifier attributes (`#[implicit]` arguments, `#[uses]`, `#[use_type]`, `#[use_provider]`, `#[default_impl]`) off the block, folds each into the impl generics or method bodies, and — when the `for Context` clause is omitted — inserts the reserved `__Context__` parameter so later stages always see an explicit context. It records the provider trait path and the context type on the resulting `LoweredCgpImpl`.
- **`LoweredCgpImpl::lower`** performs the consumer-to-provider rewrite: it swaps the provider type into the `Self` position, moves the context to the leading argument of the provider trait, rewrites `self`/`Self` with the [`replace_self` visitors](../asts/cgp_impl.md#the-replace_self-visitors), and hands the result to [`#[cgp_provider]`](cgp_provider.md)'s `ItemCgpProvider::lower`. The `#[cgp_impl(Self)]` special case skips the rewrite entirely and passes the block through unchanged.

## Generated items

For a normal provider, the macro emits exactly what `#[cgp_provider]` emits — the provider impl, its derived `IsProviderFor` impl, and (when `new` is set) the provider struct — plus one delegation impl per `#[default_impl]` attribute. The interesting work is upstream of that handoff: turning consumer-style syntax into the provider impl.

The lowering swaps the `Self` type to the provider, adds the context as the provider trait's leading type argument, and rewrites the receiver into a context parameter. A method that took `&self` becomes a static method taking the context by a snake-cased, double-underscored name derived from the context type:

```rust
// consumer-style input
#[cgp_impl(new ValueToString)]
impl<Context> FooProvider for Context {
    fn foo(&self, value: u32) -> String { value.to_string() }
}

// lowered provider impl handed to #[cgp_provider]
impl<Context> FooProvider<Context> for ValueToString {
    fn foo(__context__: &Context, value: u32) -> String { value.to_string() }
}
```

When the `for Context` clause is omitted, the inserted parameter is `__Context__`, so the same rewrite produces `__context__: &__Context__`. Both the explicit `Context` and the default `__Context__` snake-case to the same `__context__` receiver identifier.

## Behavior and corner cases

The **receiver identifier** is computed from the context type: if the context type is a bare identifier it is snake-cased and the result used as the parameter name, and any context type that is not a plain identifier falls back to the literal `__context__`. `Context` and `__Context__` both yield `__context__`. Every `self` in a body is rewritten to that identifier, every `Self` type to the context type, via the three `replace_self` visitors run in sequence.

The rewrite is **scoped to the block's own methods and stops at any nested item.** A `struct`, `impl`, `trait`, or `fn` defined *inside* a method body introduces its own `self`/`Self` scope that names that nested item — a Rust nested item cannot see the enclosing impl's `Self` or receiver — so the visitors must not rewrite it. All three `replace_self` visitors override `visit_item_mut` to a no-op, leaving a nested item untouched while still descending into closures and other expressions, which *do* capture the outer `self`. A local `impl Display for Wrapper { fn fmt(&self, …) { … self.0 … } }` inside a provider method therefore keeps its own `&self` receiver and `self.0` access. (The `visit_item_mut` guard fires only for block-nested items, since a trait's or impl's associated items are `TraitItem`/`ImplItem`, not `Item`, so a provider method or associated type declared at the block level is still rewritten.)

Inside a **macro body** the rewrite is token-level, because `VisitMut` cannot see through a `macro!( … )`. The type visitor still skips a local associated type (`Self::Output` where `Output` is declared in the block), and the value visitor still distinguishes the two meanings of `self`: a bare `self` value becomes the context, but a `self::` module path is left intact, since a value `self` is never followed by `::`. The token-level pass cannot reason about scope, so a nested item written *inside* a macro invocation does not stop the rewrite the way a nested item at the AST level does — its `self`/`Self` are still rewritten.

A **`for Context` clause is optional**, and omitting it is the idiomatic form. When present, the `Self` type of the block *is* the context and the trait path is the provider trait; when absent, `ItemCgpImpl::lower` treats the block's `Self` type as the provider trait path and inserts `__Context__` at the front of the impl generics.

**Local associated types are preserved by name.** A `type Output = …` the block declares itself is collected before the rewrite so the `replace_self` type visitor leaves `Self::Output` alone rather than rewriting it to the context — only imported abstract types (`Self::Error` from `#[use_type]`) and receiver `self`/`Self` are rewritten.

The **companion attributes** are applied in `ItemCgpImpl::lower` before the provider rewrite: `#[implicit]` parameters are extracted from each signature and turned into `HasField` bounds on the context (and reads in the body), `#[uses(...)]` and `#[use_provider(...)]` add `Self` trait bounds to the impl generics, `#[use_type(...)]` imports an abstract type and rewrites its occurrences, and each `#[default_impl]` becomes a separate `DelegateComponent`-style impl emitted alongside the provider.

The **`#[cgp_impl(Self)]` passthrough** bypasses the whole rewrite: when the provider type is the literal `Self`, `LoweredCgpImpl::lower` returns the original `impl` block unchanged as an ordinary consumer-trait impl, so companion attributes still apply while the body keeps its `self` receiver. This form requires the `for Context` clause; omitting it is rejected with a spanned "Expected context type to be specified" error.

## Error spans

Because the macro starts from the user's own `syn::ItemImpl` and rewrites it in place, the provider impl and its derived `IsProviderFor` impl keep the user's spans on their `impl` keyword, generics, self type, and body — so a coherence conflict (`E0119`) between two providers already underlines the offending `#[cgp_impl]` block rather than the macro name, exactly as two hand-written impls would. Two tokens are synthesized rather than cloned, and both are aimed at what the user wrote so they cannot leak the `call_site` span: `to_raw_item_impl` gives the provider impl's `for` token the original `for` token's span (explicit `impl Trait for Context` form) or the provider trait path's span (bare `impl Trait` form), and the [`IsProviderFor` derivation](../asts/cgp_provider.md#itemproviderimpl-and-the-isproviderfor-derivation) reuses that same `for` token for its own header.

The one token in the derived `IsProviderFor<Component, …>` impl that stays on `call_site` is the derived component reference, and deliberately so. It anchors no caret, so a narrower span gains nothing, and giving it the provider trait's span would make go-to-definition on the provider trait a user wrote also offer the component struct — because rust-analyzer maps a source token to its expansion by source range. The [`IsProviderFor` derivation](../asts/cgp_provider.md#itemproviderimpl-and-the-isproviderfor-derivation) keeps it on `call_site`, off every user token's range.

The one wholly-synthesized item is each `#[default_impl]` delegation impl, built entirely from quasi-quoted tokens whose `impl`/`{ … }` boundary carries `call_site`. `DefaultImplAttribute::to_item_impl` re-spans that boundary onto the user-written key token — with [`override_item_span`](delegate_components.md#error-spans), the same helper the `delegate_components!` impls use — so a conflict between two default impls for the same key points at the key inside `#[default_impl(Key in …)]` rather than at the whole `#[cgp_impl]` attribute. Only the boundary moves; the interior tokens — the provider type, a per-entry generic, each synthesized reference — keep their spans, so the user's tokens stay navigable in an IDE.

## Failure modes

Both failures below are ones `#[cgp_impl]` defers to the compiler, and both are the [conflicting wiring](../../errors/wiring/conflicting-wiring.md) error class; what this document pins is where each caret lands. Each is covered by a `cargo-cgp` UI fixture, linked per case below.

A **duplicate provider name** — two `#[cgp_impl(new Foo)]` blocks — declares `pub struct Foo;` twice (`E0428`) and emits two conflicting provider impls (`E0119`). The `E0428` carets land on the `Foo` inside each `#[cgp_impl(new …)]` and the `E0119` carets on each provider `impl` block, per [Error spans](#error-spans). Pinned by [`acceptable/wiring/duplicate-keys/duplicate_provider_name.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/wiring/duplicate-keys/duplicate_provider_name.rs).

A **duplicate `#[default_impl]` key** — two `#[cgp_impl]` blocks each registering the same key as a per-type default in the same namespace — emits two conflicting delegation impls and fails with `E0119`. The carets land on the `Key` inside each `#[default_impl(Key in …)]` per [Error spans](#error-spans). Pinned by [`acceptable/wiring/namespace-paths/duplicate_default_impl.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/wiring/namespace-paths/duplicate_default_impl.rs).

## Known issues

The `#[cgp_impl(Self)]` form requires an explicit `for Context` clause and errors cleanly when it is missing. In this form the `new` keyword and the `: ComponentType` override are silently ignored rather than rejected: the `Bare` branch returns the `impl` block untouched and never consults `args.new` or `args.component_type`, so `#[cgp_impl(new Self)]` and `#[cgp_impl(Self: SomeComponent)]` parse and compile but have the same effect as a plain `#[cgp_impl(Self)]`. This is harmless — neither option is meaningful for a direct consumer-trait impl — but a stricter parser would reject them. A `#[default_impl]` on the same form is *not* ignored: `ItemCgpImpl::lower` builds the registration impls before the branch is chosen and the entry point emits them regardless, with `provider_type` still the literal `Self`, so the registration reads `type Delegate = Self` and names the key rather than a provider (see [asts/attributes/default_impl.md](../asts/attributes/default_impl.md#known-issues)). Beyond this, the macro has no known limitations specific to it apart from those inherited from [`#[cgp_provider]`](cgp_provider.md) (see its Known issues).

## Snapshots

Every `snapshot_cgp_impl!` invocation across the suite is indexed here, since these snapshots all belong to this entrypoint:

- [basic_delegation/provider_macro.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/provider_macro.rs) — the canonical plain expansion: `#[cgp_impl(new ValueToString)]` on an explicit `impl<Context> FooProvider for Context`, showing the `Self`-to-provider swap, the leading-context insertion, and `&self` becoming `__context__: &Context`.
- [implicit_arguments/cgp_impl_implicit.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/implicit_arguments/cgp_impl_implicit.rs) — `#[implicit]` arguments dropped from the signature and turned into `HasField` reads, with the implicit `__Context__` inserted (the `for` clause omitted).
- [higher_order_providers/use_provider_impl.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/higher_order_providers/use_provider_impl.rs) — a generic higher-order provider `ScaledArea<Inner>` with `#[use_provider]` completing the inner provider's bound.
- [namespaces/default_impls.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/namespaces/default_impls.rs) — several `#[cgp_impl]` blocks (`ShowString`, `ShowWithDisplay`, `ShowU32`) providing a generic component, exercising the `#[default_impl]` companion attribute alongside the provider rewrite.
- [basic_delegation/self_local_assoc_type.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/self_local_assoc_type.rs) confirms the other half of the rewrite's scoping: a `Self::Label` naming an associated type the block itself declares is *not* rewritten, so the emitted provider impl keeps `Self::Label` — where `Self` is the provider that declares it — while `self.name()` in the same body is still rewritten to the context.
- [basic_delegation/provider_component_override.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/provider_component_override.rs) — the `: ComponentType` override: `#[cgp_impl(new FortyTwo: HasFooComponent)]` targets a component whose marker name (`HasFooComponent`) is not the derived `FooProviderComponent`, so the `IsProviderFor` impl names the overriding component rather than the default.

The `#[cgp_impl(Self)]` bare-impl passthrough has no snapshot yet.

## Tests

The behavioral tests confirm the lowered wiring works:

- [basic_delegation/provider_macro.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/provider_macro.rs) wires `FooProviderComponent` to the generated `ValueToString` and checks the call resolves at run time.
- [implicit_arguments/cgp_impl_implicit.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/implicit_arguments/cgp_impl_implicit.rs) wires the implicit-argument provider through `delegate_and_check_components!` and confirms the field reads compute the area.
- [higher_order_providers/use_provider_impl.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/higher_order_providers/use_provider_impl.rs) wires the scaled higher-order provider onto a context and runs it.
- [basic_delegation/impl_self.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/impl_self.rs) exercises the `#[cgp_impl(Self)]` passthrough: a consumer trait implemented directly on a concrete context, forwarding to a provider via `#[use_provider]`.
- [basic_delegation/self_in_macro.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/self_in_macro.rs) confirms the token-level `self` rewrite inside a macro body distinguishes a bare `self` value (rewritten) from a `self::` module path (left intact).
- [basic_delegation/self_in_nested_item.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/self_in_nested_item.rs) confirms the rewrite stops at a nested item: a local `impl Display for Wrapper` inside a provider method keeps its own `&self` receiver and `self.0` access while the outer `self.name()` is still rewritten to the context.
- [basic_delegation/provider_component_override.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/basic_delegation/provider_component_override.rs) wires the overriding component (`HasFooComponent`) to the generated `FortyTwo` and confirms `App` implements `CanDoFoo` — proving the `: ComponentType` override is honored rather than ignored in favor of the derived name.

The rejection cases confirm the macro refuses malformed input:

- [parser_rejections/cgp_impl.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-macro-tests/tests/parser_rejections/cgp_impl.rs) checks that an empty attribute (no provider name), a `#[cgp_impl(Self)]` block missing its `for` clause, and application to a non-`impl` item are each rejected.
