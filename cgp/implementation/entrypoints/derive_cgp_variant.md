# `#[derive(CgpVariant)]` — implementation

`#[derive(CgpVariant)]` is `#[derive(CgpData)]` restricted to enums: it emits the full extensible-variant machinery — the representation impls, the `FromVariant` constructors, and the incremental extractor — and refuses non-enum input. This document covers the entry point and its shared codegen; for the accepted syntax and the full expansion, read the reference document [reference/derives/derive_cgp_variant.md](../../reference/derives/derive_cgp_variant.md).

## Entry point

The macro is driven by the `derive_cgp_variant` function in [cgp-macro-lib/src/cgp_variant.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/macros/cgp-macro-lib/src/cgp_variant.rs). It parses the input into an `ItemCgpVariant` and calls `to_items`:

```rust
let variant: ItemCgpVariant = parse2(body)?;
let items = variant.to_items()?;
```

`ItemCgpVariant::Parse` parses a `syn::ItemEnum`, so applying the derive to a struct or other item fails at parse time — the only behavioral difference from `#[derive(CgpData)]` on an enum, which reaches the same `to_items` through `ItemCgpData`.

## Pipeline and generated items

There is no multi-stage transform. `ItemCgpVariant::to_items` concatenates three slices in a fixed order — the five representation impls over a *sum* (`HasFields`, `HasFieldsRef`, `FromFields`, `ToFields`, `ToFieldsRef`), the per-variant `FromVariant` constructors, and the incremental extractor items (the `__Partial{Name}` and `__PartialRef{Name}` enums, `PartialData` for each, `HasExtractor`/`HasExtractorRef`/`HasExtractorMut`, `FinalizeExtract` for each, then the per-variant `ExtractField` impls). These are exactly the outputs of the enum path of [`#[derive(HasFields)]`](derive_has_fields.md), [`#[derive(FromVariant)]`](derive_from_variant.md), and [`#[derive(ExtractField)]`](derive_extract_field.md) respectively; this document does not repeat their item shapes.

The variant corner cases are inherited from those building blocks: variant names are keyed by [`Symbol!`](../../reference/macros/symbol.md), generics — including a lifetime parameter named `'a` — are threaded onto every impl and onto the partial enums, and every variant must be a single-unnamed-field tuple variant or the extractor and `FromVariant` codegen fail (see [`derive_extract_field`](derive_extract_field.md)). The borrowed extractor introduces its own lifetime under the reserved name `'__a__` precisely so it never collides with the enum's own `'a`. An enum with *no* variants is special-cased so its degenerate expansion still compiles — the borrowed partial enum becomes a bare empty enum and the borrowed accessors match the dereferenced place; see [`derive_extract_field`'s Behavior and corner cases](derive_extract_field.md#behavior-and-corner-cases). Error spans are inherited the same way: each generated impl is already re-spanned onto the token it derives from (a per-variant impl onto its variant, a whole-enum impl onto the enum name), so a coherence conflict points there rather than at the whole `#[derive(CgpVariant)]` — see [`#[derive(HasField)]`](derive_has_field.md#error-spans). The [`cgp_data` AST stack](../asts/cgp_data.md) documents `ItemCgpVariant` and its methods, and [`derive_cgp_data`](derive_cgp_data.md) covers the umbrella derive this is a restriction of.

## Tests

`#[derive(CgpVariant)]` has no snapshot macro of its own; its expansion is identical to the enum path of `#[derive(CgpData)]` and is pinned by the `snapshot_derive_cgp_data!` snapshots indexed in [derive_cgp_data.md's Snapshots section](derive_cgp_data.md#snapshots).

- The behavioral variant tests in [crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_variants/](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/tree/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_variants/) — notably [shape_dispatch.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_variants/shape_dispatch.rs), [shape_dispatch_ref.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_variants/shape_dispatch_ref.rs), and [variant_dispatch.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_variants/variant_dispatch.rs) — exercise the extractor and constructors this derive produces.
- [derive_cgp_data_lifetime.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_variants/derive_cgp_data_lifetime.rs) derives the machinery on an `enum Message<'a>` and drives the owned, borrowed, and mutable extractors, guarding against the borrowed extractor's lifetime colliding with the enum's own `'a`.
- [derive_cgp_data_empty.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-tests/tests/extensible_variants/derive_cgp_data_empty.rs) snapshots the variantless-enum expansion, pinning the empty-enum special case.
- [parser_rejections/derive_from_variant.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/tests/cgp-macro-tests/tests/parser_rejections/derive_from_variant.rs) pins that `#[derive(CgpVariant)]` refuses a non-enum item at parse time, and that the shared single-unnamed-field requirement rejects malformed variants.
