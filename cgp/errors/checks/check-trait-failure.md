# Check-trait failure (surfaced)

A check forces an unsatisfied impl-side dependency through `IsProviderFor`, so the compiler names the real missing bound (`E0277`) at the wiring site — the surfaced counterpart of the [hidden unsatisfied dependency](../hidden/unsatisfied-dependency.md), produced from the very same mistake.

## What triggers it

This class arises from exactly the mistake behind the [hidden class](../hidden/unsatisfied-dependency.md) — a provider wired onto a context that cannot meet the provider's impl-side dependency — but exercised through a [`check_components!`](../../reference/macros/check_components.md) assertion (or the fused `delegate_and_check_components!`) instead of a direct method call. The check is what changes the outcome: it asserts `CanUseComponent` for each listed component, and that assertion requires `IsProviderFor` as a *direct* bound, which forces the compiler to evaluate the provider's `where` clause rather than suppressing it.

```rust
#[cgp_component(Greeter)]
pub trait CanGreet {
    fn greet(&self);
}

#[cgp_auto_getter]
pub trait HasName {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
}

#[cgp_impl(new GreetHello)]
impl Greeter
where
    Self: HasName, // impl-side dependency
{
    fn greet(&self) {
        let _ = self.name();
    }
}

#[derive(HasField)]
pub struct Person {
    pub age: u8, // no `name` field
}

delegate_components! {
    Person {
        GreeterComponent: GreetHello,
    }
}

// Forces the failure here, at the wiring, instead of at a later call site.
check_components! {
    Person {
        GreeterComponent,
    }
}
```

A `check_components!` is the canonical way to force this diagnostic, but it is not the only one: any *direct* obligation on a capability bound produces the same shape. A [`#[use_type]`](../../reference/attributes/use_type.md) foreign import (`HasScalarType.Scalar in Types`) puts the capability bound `Types: HasScalarType` — grounded to `<Self as HasTypes>::Types: HasScalarType` for a nested import — onto the *generated trait itself*, so asserting or using that trait for a context whose supplied type does not implement the capability surfaces the identical `E0277` with a capability leaf, without any `check_components!`. Here the `required for …` chain runs through the trait's own `where` bound (`required by a bound in CanCalculateArea` / `GetScalar`) rather than through `CanUseComponent`, but the leaf, the `DelegateComponent`/`IsProviderFor` `help:`, and the position of the cause are the same.

## The raw diagnostic

This section describes what plain `cargo check` prints — the fallback when `cargo-cgp` is not on hand; [How cargo-cgp presents it](#how-cargo-cgp-presents-it) below covers the readable form. This is a **surfaced** class: the compiler prints an `E0277` that names the concrete missing bound, unlike the hidden class that omits it. The primary error reports that `Person: CanUseComponent<GreeterComponent>` is not satisfied, and its caret lands on the `GreeterComponent` entry *inside the `check_components!` block* — not on the `Person` context type — because the check re-spans the shared context token onto each listed component in turn. Immediately below, a `help:` note gives the actual unmet leaf bound: that `HasField<Symbol!("name")>` is not implemented for `Person`, "but trait `HasField<Symbol!("age")>` is implemented for it." That second half is a useful landmark — the compiler is pointing at the *nearest existing* field impl, which tells you the context has a field, just not the one the provider expects.

Below the `help:` note, a `required for …` chain traces the dependency path outward from the leaf: `Person` to implement `HasName`, then `GreetHello` to implement `IsProviderFor<GreeterComponent, Person>`, then `Person` to implement `CanUseComponent<GreeterComponent>`, and finally the bound in the generated `__CheckPerson` trait that the `check_components!` block emitted. The chain is the scaffolding; the leaf in the `help:` note is the cause.

What makes the cause visible is that the check produces a *direct* trait obligation, and this is where the class differs mechanically from its hidden twin. A `check_components!` asserts `Person: CanUseComponent<GreeterComponent>` as a bound on the generated `__CheckPerson` trait, so the solver must prove that bound outright — and proving it means discharging the whole `where`-clause chain down to the leaf and reporting the first bound that cannot be met. The `required for …` notes are simply `rustc`'s ordinary `E0277` obligation-tracing output for that proof. It is exactly the path the [hidden class](../hidden/unsatisfied-dependency.md) never takes: a method call lets the solver abandon an inapplicable blanket impl at the top instead of proving a direct bound, so it never descends to the leaf. [`IsProviderFor`](../../reference/traits/is_provider_for.md) is the supertrait that carries the provider's own `where` clause into this chain, which is why the leaf is named here and suppressed there. The `help:` note's "but trait `HasField<Symbol!("age")>` is implemented for it" is a second piece of standard machinery — `rustc`'s "a similar impl exists" hint, pointing at the nearest impl of the same trait to show the context has *a* field, just not the expected one.

## Where the root cause is

The root cause is **present**, and it is near the top — in the compiler's `help:` note, not at the end of the output. This is the opposite of what a reader might expect from a long note chain: the concrete unmet bound (`HasField<Symbol!("name")>`) is stated early, and the `required for …` notes that follow build *outward* from it toward the check trait, rather than drilling down to it. The caret's position is the other half of the value — it sits on the wiring entry the user controls, so the error points at the fix site rather than at a distant call. When many providers depend transitively on one leaf, the output multiplies into a [verbose cascade](verbose-cascade.md), and the position guidance shifts to *which block* carries the actionable cause; for a single checked component it is simply the `help:` note.

## When the derive is missing entirely

A distinct sub-case of this class is worth recognizing because its fix differs and its diagnostic drops the usual landmark: the mistake is not a missing *field* but a missing `#[derive(HasField)]` on the context altogether. When the struct has the field the getter names but no derive, it has *no* `HasField` impls at all, so the getter trait is still unsatisfiable and the check still fails with the same `CanUseComponent` / `IsProviderFor` / `HasField` shape. The tell is what is *absent*: the `help:` note names the missing `HasField<Symbol!("name")>` and points at the `struct` definition, but there is **no** "but trait `HasField<…>` is implemented for it" line, because the context implements the trait for no field at all. The near-impl hint that a single missing field always produces cannot appear when every field is missing.

Read the absence as its own signal: a checked context that implements `HasField` for nothing behind a `#[derive(HasField)]`-shaped requirement has most likely forgotten the derive, and the fix is to add `#[derive(HasField)]` to the struct, not to add fields one at a time. A tool handling this class should special-case it — zero `HasField` impls plus an unmet `HasField` leaf means the derive, and the headline should say so rather than sending the user after a single field.

## When the dependency is an equality-pinned abstract type

A second sub-case is worth recognizing because its diagnostic is an `E0271` rather than an `E0277`, and because the wiring it points at is a *type* choice rather than a field or a provider. An impl-side dependency can pin an [abstract type](../../concepts/abstract-types.md) to a concrete one — `#[use_type(HasErrorType.{Error = AppError})]` on a provider, which emits `Self: HasErrorType<Error = AppError>` — while the context binds that same abstract type elsewhere, by wiring its component to `UseType<T>` or by implementing the trait directly. When the two disagree, the *trait* half of the bound still holds (the context genuinely implements `HasErrorType`) and only the associated-type projection fails, so the compiler reports a type mismatch rather than an unimplemented trait.

The tell is the headline shape: `` type mismatch resolving `<MockApp as HasErrorType>::Error == AppError` ``, followed by an `expected this to be …` note whose caret lands on the `#[cgp_type]` attribute that *defined* the abstract type — nowhere near either side of the disagreement. Two things make this harder to read than the field cases above. The type the context actually supplies is nowhere in the message: rustc names only what was required, so a reader must find the wiring themselves to learn what it was required *against*. And because one abstract type is shared by everything in the context that touches it, a single wrong binding surfaces at every consumer that raises through it, multiplying into a [verbose cascade](verbose-cascade.md). The fix is to reconcile the two: bind the component to the type the provider requires, or relax the provider to accept the one the context supplies.

## When the field's required type comes from the wiring

A third sub-case sits between the two above and is worth separating because the two things that disagree are both the context's own decisions. A provider can read a field whose type is expressed through an [abstract type](../../concepts/abstract-types.md) it imports — `#[implicit] database: &Pool<Db>` under `#[use_type(HasDbType.Db)]` — so the field bound the macro emits is not `HasField<…, Value = Pool<Postgres>>` but `HasField<…, Value = Pool<Self::Db>>`, a requirement that projects through whatever the context wires for `Db`. A context that wires `Db` to one type while declaring a field of another therefore contradicts *itself*, and the failure is an `E0271` on the `HasField` projection exactly as the concrete-type case is.

The tell that distinguishes it from an ordinary mistyped field is what the raw diagnostic omits. Because rustc *normalizes* the required type before printing it, the headline reads `` type mismatch resolving `<App as HasField<Symbol<8, Chars<..>>>>::Value == Pool<Postgres>` `` — naming the wired type as though the provider had asked for it literally, with nothing to indicate the requirement came from an abstract type at all. A reader who checks the provider will find no mention of `Postgres` in it, and the field name is mangled to a `Symbol<8, Chars<..>>` spine in the same line, so neither half of the disagreement is stated in terms the author would recognize. The `expected this to be …` note's caret does land on the field declaration, which is one of the two places to change.

This is also the sub-case that shows what naming a type buys over inferring it. Had the provider taken the engine as an `#[impl_generics]` parameter inferred from the field's own type, the two could not have disagreed — there would have been one type, not two — so this diagnostic exists only because the pairing became a stated claim, and a stated claim is one a check can verify. The fix is to reconcile them: wire `Db` to the engine the field holds, or change the field to the engine the wiring names.

## How cargo-cgp presents it

`cargo-cgp` recognizes this class and leads with the cause. It keeps the `E0277` code but rewrites the headline to `[CGP-E001] the consumer trait \`CanGreet\` is not implemented for context \`Person\``, and replaces the `required for …` scaffolding with a single `root cause:` note over a compact dependency tree — `[CGP-E101]` consumer-trait-impl hop → `[CGP-E102]` provider-trait-impl hop → the leaf. The leaf is `[CGP-E106] missing field \`name\` on \`Person\`` for a genuinely absent field, or `[CGP-E108]` for the [derive-missing variant](#when-the-derive-is-missing-entirely), which coalesces every underived field on the struct into one "add `#[derive(HasField)]`" cause rather than listing them singly. The `#[use_type]` foreign-import form bottoms out on `[CGP-E107]` (the context supplies no wiring for the capability). The `Symbol!("name")` spine is resugared and the `CanUseComponent`/`IsProviderFor`/`__Check…` frames are dropped, so what remains is the field to fix and the wiring entry it hangs from. The codes are defined in the [cargo-cgp error-code catalog](../../../cargo-cgp/error-code.md).

The [wiring-derived field type](#when-the-fields-required-type-comes-from-the-wiring) takes the same `[CGP-E003]`/`[CGP-E109]` shape as a concrete mismatch, with the field name resugared and the required type given in **both** forms — `` expected a `database` field of type `Pool<<App as HasDbType>::Db>` (`Pool<Postgres>`) on `App`, but found `Pool<Sqlite>` ``. The projection comes first because it names the wiring the requirement flows from, which is where the fix goes; the reduced type follows in parentheses because it is what the reader compares against the field. This is the one sub-case where each output would otherwise carry a fact the other lacks — rustc normalizes and so states `Pool<Postgres>` without saying where it came from, while the projection alone says where without saying what — so both are printed, and a requirement that is already concrete normalizes to itself and gets no parenthetical.

The [equality-pinned abstract type](#when-the-dependency-is-an-equality-pinned-abstract-type) is reshaped the same way into its own class, `[CGP-E017]`: `` expected the abstract type `Error` of `HasErrorType` on `MockApp` to be `AppError`, but found `String` ``, over a `[CGP-E112]` leaf. Both halves of the disagreement are named — the required type read off the failing projection, the supplied one by normalizing it, so a `UseType<T>` wiring and a direct impl are read alike — and a `help` names the wiring entry to change (`` wire `ErrorTypeProviderComponent` to `UseType<AppError>` ``), recovered from the trait rather than guessed. Because one abstract type is shared, the cascade this class produces is also coalesced: every consumer that fails through it is listed in one block over a single root-cause tree.

## Resolving it

The fix is what the diagnostic already points to: satisfy the named leaf bound. Add the `name` field to `Person`, or wire the getter component to the existing field, so `Person` implements `HasName` and `GreetHello` becomes a valid provider for the component. Because the check surfaced both the concrete bound *and* the wiring entry, no further tracing is usually needed — which is exactly why the standard remedy for a [hidden](../hidden/unsatisfied-dependency.md) failure is to add a check and read this class instead.

## Notes for tooling

This class is the *target* `cargo-cgp` normalizes toward, and it already handles it fully (above). It is also where the hidden class lands once promoted: synthesizing a `check_components!` for a [hidden](../hidden/unsatisfied-dependency.md) failure produces exactly this diagnostic, so both reduce to the same `[CGP-E001]` headline and `root cause:` tree.

- [`acceptable/fields/missing_dependency.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/fields/missing_dependency.rs) — the surfaced case for `GreetHello`'s unmet `Self: HasName`; its `.rust.stderr` pins the raw `help:` note naming `HasField<Symbol!("name")>` and the caret on `GreeterComponent`, and its `.cgp.stderr` the `[CGP-E001]`/`[CGP-E106]` reshaping. Its use-site counterpart, [`acceptable/use-site/missing_dependency.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/use-site/missing_dependency.rs), reaches the same mistake by a method call — the [hidden](../hidden/unsatisfied-dependency.md) `E0599` in the raw output, which `cargo-cgp`'s next-gen solver recovers to the same headline.
- [`acceptable/use-type/use_type_foreign_unsatisfied.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/use-type/use_type_foreign_unsatisfied.rs) — the capability bound reached through a `#[use_type]` foreign import instead of a check: naming a component for a `Types` that does not implement the imported `HasScalarType` surfaces `E0277`, pinning that the foreign bound is *enforced on the generated trait* rather than silently dropped.
- [`acceptable/use-type/use_type_nested_unsatisfied.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/use-type/use_type_nested_unsatisfied.rs) — the same through a *nested* two-hop import, so the grounded bound `<Self as HasTypes>::Types: HasScalarType` is the one enforced, confirming the transitively-grounded foreign bound is checked at depth.
- [`acceptable/field-types/abstract_field_type_mismatch.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/field-types/abstract_field_type_mismatch.rs) — the [wiring-derived field type](#when-the-fields-required-type-comes-from-the-wiring): an `App` wiring `Db` to `Postgres` while declaring a `Pool<Sqlite>` field, under a provider reading `&Pool<Db>`. Its `.rust.stderr` pins the normalized `Pool<Postgres>` requirement and the mangled `Symbol<8, Chars<..>>` field name, and its `.cgp.stderr` the `[CGP-E003]`/`[CGP-E109]` reshaping with the required type given as `Pool<<App as HasDbType>::Db>` followed by `(Pool<Postgres>)` — the projection that names the wiring plus the type it resolves to. Its concrete-required-type sibling is [`field_type_mismatch`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/field-types/field_type_mismatch.rs).
- [`acceptable/types/abstract_type_mismatch.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/types/abstract_type_mismatch.rs) — the [equality-pinned abstract type](#when-the-dependency-is-an-equality-pinned-abstract-type): a context wiring `HasScalarType` to `UseType<u32>` under a provider that pins it to `f64`. Its `.rust.stderr` pins the raw `E0271` with its caret on the `#[cgp_type]` attribute and no mention of `u32`, and its `.cgp.stderr` the `[CGP-E017]`/`[CGP-E112]` reshaping with the `UseType<f64>` help.
- [`acceptable/fields/missing_has_field_derive.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/fields/missing_has_field_derive.rs) — the [derive-missing variant](#when-the-derive-is-missing-entirely): a `Person` with the `name` field but no `#[derive(HasField)]`, so the raw output drops the "but trait `HasField<…>` is implemented" landmark (the signal the whole derive is missing), and `cargo-cgp` coalesces it to one `[CGP-E108]` cause. Related field-derive fixtures — [`base_area_2`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/fields/base_area_2.rs), [`empty_field_struct`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/fields/empty_field_struct.rs), [`underived_and_missing_field`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/fields/underived_and_missing_field.rs) — pin the coalescing and the mixed missing-plus-underived case.
