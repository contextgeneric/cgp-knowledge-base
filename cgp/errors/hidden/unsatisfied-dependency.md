# Unsatisfied dependency (hidden)

A provider is wired onto a context that cannot satisfy the provider's impl-side dependency, and the failure is triggered by calling the consumer-trait method directly — so the compiler reports only that the method's trait bounds are unsatisfied (`E0599`, or `E0277` when the consumer trait is used as a bound) and hides the dependency that actually failed.

## What triggers it

This class arises whenever [wiring](../../reference/macros/delegate_components.md) is lazy and the mistake is exercised through the consumer trait rather than a check. A provider carries an impl-side dependency in its `where` clause; a context is wired to that provider but does not meet the dependency; and because `delegate_components!` records the entry without verifying the provider's transitive requirements, the wiring is accepted. The failure appears only when the context's consumer-trait method is finally called. The dependency's leaf can be any bound the provider names — a missing `HasField`, an unmet CGP capability like `HasName`, or an [ordinary Rust trait bound](../checks/ordinary-trait-bound.md) such as `Scalar: Eq` on an abstract type — and the hidden form suppresses it identically in every case, because the compiler's method-probe heuristic drops the nested bound without inspecting what it is.

```rust
#[cgp_component(Greeter)]
pub trait CanGreet {
    fn greet(&self);
}

#[cgp_auto_getter]
pub trait HasName {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
}

#[cgp_impl(new GreetHello)]
impl Greeter
where
    Self: HasName, // impl-side dependency
{
    fn greet(&self) {
        let _ = self.name();
    }
}

#[derive(HasField)]
pub struct Person {
    pub age: u8, // no `name` field, so Person does not implement HasName
}

// Accepted even though Person cannot satisfy GreetHello's `Self: HasName`.
delegate_components! {
    Person {
        GreeterComponent: GreetHello,
    }
}

fn main() {
    Person { age: 0 }.greet(); // fails here, at the call site
}
```

The same hiding occurs, in a slightly different shape, when the consumer trait is used as a bound — `fn use_it<C: CanGreet>(c: &C)` called on a `Person` — rather than as a direct method call. Both exercise the broken wiring through the consumer trait, and both hide the cause; the difference is only the error code.

## The raw diagnostic

This section describes what plain `cargo check` prints — the fallback when `cargo-cgp` is not on hand; [How cargo-cgp presents it](#how-cargo-cgp-presents-it) below covers the recovered form, which for this class is not a reformat but a genuinely different output. This is a **hidden** class: the compiler prints a short diagnostic that names the traits it could not satisfy but never descends to the dependency that failed. Calling the method directly produces an `E0599` — "the method `greet` exists for struct `Person`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied" — whose notes state that `Person` does not satisfy `Person: CanGreet` or `Person: Greeter<Person>` and that the trait `Greeter` must be implemented, and then stop. Using the consumer trait as a `where` bound instead produces an `E0277` reporting that `Person: CanGreet` is not satisfied, again without expanding why. In neither shape does the output mention `HasName` or the missing `HasField<Symbol!("name")>` — the real cause is absent, not merely buried.

The `E0599` form carries one more piece of misdirection worth naming so a reader discounts it. Alongside the unsatisfied-bound notes, the compiler adds "this is an associated function, not a method," reports `greet` under "found the following associated functions," and suggests rewriting the call as `Person::greet()`. This is an artifact of how `#[cgp_component]` lowers the method: the provider trait's `greet(context: &Context)` has no `self` receiver, so the method probe classifies it as an associated function. The suggestion is wrong — `Person::greet()` drops the required context argument — and it says nothing about the missing dependency; it is noise the class produces, not a clue.

The reason the cause is absent is a deliberate compiler heuristic, and it is the whole point of isolating this class. `#[cgp_component]` emits a blanket impl of the consumer trait for any context that is its own provider, so when the compiler checks `Person: CanGreet` it finds that blanket impl (alongside every other candidate impl in scope), determines it does not apply because `Person: Greeter<Person>` is unmet, and declines to expand the nested `where` bound that made it inapplicable. `rustc` does not, in general, report *which* `where`-clause bound of an inapplicable blanket impl failed — it reports only that the top-level trait is unimplemented and stops — because with a blanket impl and multiple candidates present, expanding every candidate's unmet sub-bound would usually be noise. This is a long-standing, acknowledged limitation of the `E0599` diagnostic, tracked upstream in [rust-lang/rust#61661](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/61661) and [#75222](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75222), not a quirk of CGP. The suppression is exactly what CGP's [`IsProviderFor`](../../reference/traits/is_provider_for.md) supertrait exists to defeat — but only a check that requires `IsProviderFor` *directly* forces the compiler past the heuristic; the lazy consumer-trait path never does.

The same `E0599`/`E0277` shape, and the same absence of a cause, also arises when the wiring is not merely *unmet* but *missing* — a component never wired on the context, or an [unregistered namespace path](../checks/unregistered-namespace-path.md) whose redirect lands on an empty table slot. Whether a provider was found but its dependency failed, or no provider was found at all, the consumer-trait path hides it identically; the two are told apart only by promoting the error into a surfaced one.

## Where the root cause is

The root cause is **not present in the output.** A reader or tool must not scan this diagnostic for the failing dependency, because the compiler discarded it before printing. The most specific thing the output names is the unsatisfied provider trait (`Person: Greeter<Person>`) or consumer trait (`Person: CanGreet`); everything below that — the missing field, the unmet `HasName`, any deeper transitive bound — is gone. This absence is the defining property of the class and the reason it lives apart from the [surfaced classes](../checks/), whose diagnostics *do* carry the cause.

## How cargo-cgp presents it

`cargo-cgp` is the reason this class need not stay hidden, and it is the one class where the tool does more than reshape existing text: its next-generation trait solver **recovers the cause the raw `E0599` discarded.** Where plain `cargo check` prints a diagnostic that bottoms out at `Person: Greeter<Person>` and names no dependency, `cargo-cgp` keeps the Rust code (`E0599` at a call site, `E0277` at a `where` bound) but rewrites the headline to `[CGP-E001] the consumer trait \`CanGreet\` is not implemented for context \`Person\`` and attaches a `root cause:` note — a `[CGP-E106] missing field \`name\` on \`Person\`` leaf over a compact dependency tree that the raw output never contained at all: `[CGP-E101]` consumer-trait hop → `[CGP-E102]` provider-trait hop → `[CGP-E105]` the `HasName` capability → the `[CGP-E106]` field leaf. The method-probe misdirection — "this is an associated function, not a method" and the wrong `Person::greet()` suggestion — is dropped, so the recovered cause leads instead of the noise.

The leaf the tree bottoms out on names the actual mistake, and it varies with the suppressed dependency's kind. A genuinely absent field is `[CGP-E106]`; a struct that never derived `HasField` coalesces to `[CGP-E108]`; a component the context never wired, or an [unregistered namespace path](../checks/unregistered-namespace-path.md), is `[CGP-E107] does not contain any delegate entry`. When the buried leaf is an [ordinary Rust trait bound](../checks/ordinary-trait-bound.md) such as `Scalar: Eq`, the tree's terminal passes the bound through in rustc's own words and the `root cause:` lead takes `[CGP-E201]` instead. In every case the recovered result matches, byte for byte, what a [check-trait failure](../checks/check-trait-failure.md) produces for the same mistake — which is exactly how `cargo-cgp` recovers it, by promoting the hidden bound to the direct one the solver will trace. The codes are defined in the [cargo-cgp error-code catalog](../../../cargo-cgp/error-code.md).

## Resolving it

The underlying fix is ordinary: give the context what the provider needs — add the `name` field to `Person`, or wire the getter component to an existing field — so `Person` satisfies `HasName` and `GreetHello` becomes a valid provider. The difficulty is not the fix but *finding* it, since the error points nowhere useful.

To make the cause visible, **promote the hidden error into a surfaced one** by forcing the check at the wiring site with [`check_components!`](../../reference/macros/check_components.md):

```rust
check_components! {
    Person {
        GreeterComponent,
    }
}
```

The check asserts `CanUseComponent<GreeterComponent>` for `Person`, which requires `GreetHello: IsProviderFor<GreeterComponent, Person>` as a *direct* bound. That defeats the suppression heuristic, and the compiler now reports the full `E0277` note chain ending at the missing `HasField<Symbol!("name")>`. That surfaced form is the [check-trait failure](../checks/check-trait-failure.md) class, and moving between the two is the standard technique the [debugging guide](../../guides/debugging.md) prescribes for a hidden dependency.

## Notes for tooling

The move this class needs — inspecting the fulfillment errors the trait solver produced but the diagnostic heuristic suppressed, rather than reformatting text that never held the cause — is exactly what `cargo-cgp`'s typed resolver already performs (above), which is why this class is *replaced* rather than reshaped. What remains useful to a plainer tool, or to a reader on the raw fallback, is recognizing the class without the cause: an `E0599` "method exists but its trait bounds were not satisfied" whose unmet bound is a provider trait of the form `Context: SomeProvider<Context>`, or an `E0277` on a consumer trait backed by a `…Component` blanket impl, with no note descending past that bound. A text-only post-processor cannot recover the cause here — only re-driving the solver (or promoting to a check) can.

## Backing fixtures

- [`acceptable/use-site/missing_dependency.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/use-site/missing_dependency.rs) — `GreetHello` requires `Self: HasName`, `Person` lacks the `name` field, and the method is called directly; its `.rust.stderr` pins the raw `E0599` that names `Person: Greeter<Person>` (plus the method-probe advice) without descending to the missing field, and its `.cgp.stderr` the recovered `[CGP-E001]` headline over a `root cause: [CGP-E106] missing field \`name\`` tree. Its checked counterpart, [`acceptable/fields/missing_dependency.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/fields/missing_dependency.rs), reaches the same mistake through a check and belongs to the [check-trait failure](../checks/check-trait-failure.md) class.
- [`acceptable/use-site/ordinary_bound_unsatisfied.rs`](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp/blob/main/tests/ui/acceptable/use-site/ordinary_bound_unsatisfied.rs) — the same hidden `E0599` where the suppressed leaf is an *ordinary* trait bound (`Scalar: Eq`, with `f64` wired) rather than a `HasField`, confirming the heuristic drops the nested bound regardless of its kind; its `.cgp.stderr` recovers the cause as a `[CGP-E001]` headline over a `root cause: [CGP-E201] the trait bound \`f64: Eq\` is not satisfied` tree. Its surfaced counterpart is the [unsatisfied ordinary trait bound](../checks/ordinary-trait-bound.md) class.
