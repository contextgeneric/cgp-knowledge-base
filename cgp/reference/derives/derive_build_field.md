# `#[derive(BuildField)]`

`#[derive(BuildField)]` derives just the incremental-builder machinery for a struct: a partial companion type plus the `HasBuilder`, `IntoBuilder`, `PartialData`, `FinalizeBuild`, and `UpdateField` impls that let the struct be assembled one field at a time.

## Purpose

`#[derive(BuildField)]` gives a struct a type-checked, field-by-field builder without the rest of the extensible-data machinery. It is the building block that supplies the *construction* half of a record: starting from an empty value, setting fields individually or copying them in bulk from other records, and finalizing only once every field is present. It exists as a standalone derive for cases where you want the builder but not the field representation traits — though in practice most code reaches for [`#[derive(CgpRecord)]`](derive_cgp_record.md) or [`#[derive(CgpData)]`](derive_cgp_data.md), which include this output.

The builder's distinguishing property is that field presence is tracked in the type, not at runtime. The derive generates a *partial* companion struct whose type parameters record, per field, whether that field is present, absent, or void. Generic builder providers advance those parameters as fields are added, and the finalize step is implemented only for the fully-present configuration. A premature finalize is therefore a compile error rather than a runtime failure.

The capability is exposed through `BuildField`, which is not generated per type but defined once in the field crate as a blanket impl over the generated `UpdateField` impls. `build_field` sets one field on a partial value; the surrounding `HasBuilder`/`IntoBuilder`/`FinalizeBuild` traits start and end the build.

## Syntax

The derive is applied to a struct and takes no arguments:

```rust
use cgp::prelude::*;

#[derive(BuildField)]
pub struct Person {
    pub first_name: String,
    pub last_name: String,
}
```

Each named field becomes a type-level string `Symbol!` used as the field's `Tag`, and its declared type becomes its value type. A tuple struct works equally well: an unnamed field at position `N` is keyed by [`Index<N>`](../types/index.md) instead of a `Symbol!`. Generic parameters on the struct are carried onto the generated impls. The derive emits the same builder impls that the record path of [`#[derive(CgpData)]`](derive_cgp_data.md) emits — it is that slice in isolation, with no `HasField` getters or `HasFields` representation traits.

A fieldless struct is the degenerate case rather than an error: the partial companion type takes no `MapType` parameters at all, so it has exactly one configuration and `HasBuilder`, `IntoBuilder`, and `FinalizeBuild` all name it. The practical consequence is that `builder()` is already finalizable, because the present/absent tracking has nothing to track.

## Expansion

`#[derive(BuildField)]` expands into a partial companion struct and the traits that drive it. The symbols below are abbreviated as `Symbol!("name")` in place of the full `Symbol<Len, Chars<...>>` form. Starting from:

```rust
#[derive(BuildField)]
pub struct Person {
    pub first_name: String,
    pub last_name: String,
}
```

it first emits the partial struct `__PartialPerson`, with one `MapType` parameter per field. The marker decides how each field is stored: `IsPresent` maps `T` to `T`, `IsNothing` maps `T` to `()`, and `IsVoid` maps `T` to the empty `Void` type:

```rust
pub struct __PartialPerson<__F0__: MapType, __F1__: MapType> {
    pub first_name: <__F0__ as MapType>::Map<String>,
    pub last_name: <__F1__ as MapType>::Map<String>,
}
```

It then emits the entry and exit points. `HasBuilder` starts an empty builder (`IsNothing, IsNothing`); `IntoBuilder` turns an existing value into a fully-present builder; `PartialData` records that any configuration of the partial type targets `Person`; and `FinalizeBuild` reconstructs the struct, implemented only for the all-`IsPresent` configuration:

```rust
impl HasBuilder for Person {
    type Builder = __PartialPerson<IsNothing, IsNothing>;
    fn builder() -> Self::Builder { __PartialPerson { first_name: (), last_name: () } }
}

impl IntoBuilder for Person {
    type Builder = __PartialPerson<IsPresent, IsPresent>;
    fn into_builder(self) -> Self::Builder { __PartialPerson { first_name: self.first_name, last_name: self.last_name } }
}

impl<__F0__: MapType, __F1__: MapType> PartialData for __PartialPerson<__F0__, __F1__> {
    type Target = Person;
}

impl FinalizeBuild for __PartialPerson<IsPresent, IsPresent> {
    fn finalize_build(self) -> Self::Target { Person { first_name: self.first_name, last_name: self.last_name } }
}
```

Next it emits, per field, an `UpdateField` impl. `UpdateField<Tag, M>` changes one field's marker from its current state to `M`, returning the old value alongside the rebuilt partial struct. This is the primitive that everything else builds on:

```rust
impl<__M1__: MapType, __M2__: MapType, __F1__: MapType>
    UpdateField<Symbol!("first_name"), __M2__> for __PartialPerson<__M1__, __F1__>
{
    type Value = String;
    type Mapper = __M1__;                                   // the field's prior marker
    type Output = __PartialPerson<__M2__, __F1__>;          // first_name now in state __M2__
    fn update_field(self, _: PhantomData<Symbol!("first_name")>, value: __M2__::Map<String>)
        -> (__M1__::Map<String>, Self::Output)
    { (self.first_name, __PartialPerson { first_name: value, last_name: self.last_name }) }
}
// plus the analogous UpdateField for "last_name"
```

Finally it emits, per field, a [`HasField`](../traits/has_field.md) impl on the partial type that is in scope only when that field's marker is `IsPresent`, so an already-set field can be read back out of a partially-built value:

```rust
impl<__F1__: MapType> HasField<Symbol!("first_name")> for __PartialPerson<IsPresent, __F1__> {
    type Value = String;
    fn get_field(&self, _: PhantomData<Symbol!("first_name")>) -> &String { &self.first_name }
}
// plus the analogous HasField for "last_name"
```

Neither `BuildField` nor its reverse is emitted by the derive. Both are defined once in the field crate as blanket impls over the generated `UpdateField`, which is why `UpdateField` — the more general trait, parameterized by the marker to move *to* — is the one the derive actually writes. `BuildField<Tag>` covers any type implementing `UpdateField<Tag, IsPresent, Mapper = IsNothing>`, the absent-to-present transition, so `build_field` is sugar over `update_field` in that one direction. `TakeField<Tag>` covers `UpdateField<Tag, IsNothing, Mapper = IsPresent>`, the present-to-absent transition, so `take_field` removes a field that is already set and hands back the value alongside a partial value with that field absent. `FinalizeBuild` is likewise a field-crate subtrait of `PartialData`; the derive only provides the all-present impl.

`TakeField` is the trait behind bulk merging: `CanBuildFrom`'s `build_from` recurses over a source record's field list, taking each field out of the source and building it into the target. Unlike the rest of the family it is not in the prelude, so code calling `take_field` directly imports it from `cgp::core::field::traits`.

**That recursion is over the *source's* field list, which is why the source of a `build_from` needs [`#[derive(HasFields)]`](derive_has_fields.md) as well as this derive.** `CanBuildFrom` bounds the source on `HasFields + IntoBuilder` and walks `Source::Fields`, so a source deriving only `BuildField` has a builder of its own and still cannot be merged into anything — the error is an unsatisfied `HasFields` bound on the source type. The target needs only `BuildField`.

The key takeaway is that `builder()` yields `__PartialPerson<IsNothing, IsNothing>`, each `build_field` flips one marker to `IsPresent`, and `finalize_build` exists only at `__PartialPerson<IsPresent, IsPresent>` — so an incomplete build cannot be finalized.

Two properties of the generated companion struct are worth knowing before reaching for it directly. It **keeps the original struct's visibility**, and each field keeps its own, so a `pub struct` yields a `pub struct __PartialPerson` whose fields can be read and written positionally. But it **carries none of the original's attributes**: the derive clears them, so a `#[derive(Debug, Clone)]` on the input does not reach the partial type and a partially-built value can be neither printed nor cloned. The per-field `HasField` impls on the partial type are the supported way to read a field back out mid-build.

## Examples

The builder is driven through `builder()`, `build_field`, and `finalize_build`, with `build_from` (from the field crate's `CanBuildFrom`) copying every shared field from another record at once:

```rust
use cgp::prelude::*;
use cgp::core::field::impls::CanBuildFrom;

// The source of a `build_from` needs its field list too, so it derives `HasFields` as well.
#[derive(HasFields, BuildField)]
pub struct FooBar { pub foo: u64, pub bar: String }

#[derive(BuildField)]
pub struct FooBarBaz { pub foo: u64, pub bar: String, pub baz: bool }

fn extend(foo_bar: FooBar) -> FooBarBaz {
    FooBarBaz::builder()
        .build_from(foo_bar)                              // sets foo + bar
        .build_field(PhantomData::<Symbol!("baz")>, true) // sets baz
        .finalize_build()
}
```

Each step changes the partial type, and only after the last field is set does the all-present `FinalizeBuild` impl apply.

## Related constructs

`#[derive(BuildField)]` is one slice of the record output of [`#[derive(CgpData)]`](derive_cgp_data.md) and [`#[derive(CgpRecord)]`](derive_cgp_record.md); those derives include it alongside the [`#[derive(HasField)]`](derive_has_field.md) getters and [`#[derive(HasFields)]`](derive_has_fields.md) representation traits. Its enum analogues are [`#[derive(ExtractField)]`](derive_extract_field.md) for incremental matching and [`#[derive(FromVariant)]`](derive_from_variant.md) for variant construction. The entry and exit points it generates target the [`HasBuilder`](../traits/has_builder.md) family of traits, which also carries `TakeField`, the present-to-absent counterpart of `BuildField` that the same generated `UpdateField` impls satisfy; bulk merging through `CanBuildFrom` is documented with the other [structural casts](../traits/cast.md). The generated code reads back fields through [`HasField`](../traits/has_field.md), stores them in the [`product`](../macros/product.md)-shaped partial struct, and switches on the [`MapType`](../traits/map_type.md) markers `IsPresent`/`IsNothing`/`IsVoid`.
