# `#[use_type]`

`#[use_type]` imports an abstract associated type into a `#[cgp_fn]`, `#[cgp_impl]`, or `#[cgp_component]` definition (or into a `#[cgp_type]`, `#[cgp_getter]`, or `#[cgp_auto_getter]` trait, which share `#[cgp_component]`'s attribute collector) and rewrites every bare mention of that type into the fully-qualified `<Self as Trait>::AssocType` form, adding the trait as a supertrait or bound at the same time.

## Purpose

`#[use_type]` removes the boilerplate of referring to an abstract type that lives on another CGP trait. A CGP trait often needs a type that is defined elsewhere — a `Scalar` from `HasScalarType`, an `Error` from `HasErrorType` — and Rust requires every reference to that type to be written in fully-qualified form, `<Self as HasScalarType>::Scalar`, because a bare `Scalar` is not a type the compiler knows about. Writing that prefix on every occurrence, in the return type, in each implicit argument, and in the body, is verbose and easy to get wrong.

The attribute lets you write the bare identifier `Scalar` everywhere and have the macro expand it for you. You declare the type once in the attribute — `#[use_type(HasScalarType.Scalar)]` — and the macro replaces each standalone `Scalar` type with `<Self as HasScalarType>::Scalar`, while also adding `HasScalarType` as a supertrait of the generated trait (for `#[cgp_component]`) or as a `where`-clause bound on the impl (for `#[cgp_impl]` and `#[cgp_fn]`). The bare identifier reads like a normal generic, but resolves to the qualified associated type.

Beyond saving keystrokes, the fully-qualified rewrite removes ambiguity that the bare form cannot express. Because the macro always emits the `<Self as Trait>::Type` path, nested associated types compose without the author ever spelling out the path, foreign abstract types can be pulled from a type parameter rather than `Self`, and type-equality constraints between two imported types can be stated declaratively. These capabilities are why the `/cgp` skill recommends `#[use_type]` as the default way to import abstract types in all three macros.

## Syntax

`#[use_type]` is applied as an outer attribute alongside the `#[cgp_fn]`, `#[cgp_impl]`, or `#[cgp_component]` attribute (or one of the macros built on `#[cgp_component]`), and its argument names a trait and one or more of its associated types. A `.` separates the trait from the associated type — not `::` — which is what lets the trait itself be a full path or carry generic arguments without the parser confusing a path segment for the associated type. The simplest form imports a single type from a trait:

```rust
#[use_type(HasScalarType.Scalar)]
```

The part before the `.` is the trait and the identifier after it is the associated type to import. The rewrite target — the type the bare identifier expands into — defaults to `Self`, so the example above rewrites `Scalar` to `<Self as HasScalarType>::Scalar`.

Because the `.` is the only separator the macro looks for, the trait may be written as a full path or with generic arguments, both using ordinary `::`. `#[use_type(errors::HasErrorType.Error)]` imports from a trait named by path without bringing it into scope, and `#[use_type(HasFooType<X>.Foo)]` imports the associated type of a specific generic instantiation, rewriting `Foo` to `<Self as HasFooType<X>>::Foo`. That argument may itself be another import's alias, in which case it is resolved along with everything else — see [Expansion](#expansion). This is what makes it possible to import the same associated type from two instantiations under different aliases, as in `#[use_type(HasFooType<X>.{Foo as FooX}, HasFooType<Y>.{Foo as FooY})]`.

A trailing `in Context` clause changes the rewrite target from `Self` to a named type, which is how foreign abstract types are imported. The form `#[use_type(HasScalarType.Scalar in Types)]` treats `Types` as the context type and rewrites `Scalar` to `<Types as HasScalarType>::Scalar`. `Types` is typically a generic parameter of the function or impl rather than `Self`, which lets a trait pull an abstract type from a parameter instead of from the implementing context. The `in` keyword is reserved in Rust, so it can never be confused with a trait, type, or associated-type name and reads as a clean delimiter after the associated-type list; the clause is consistent with the `in` used elsewhere in CGP wiring, such as `#[prefix(@Path in Namespace)]`.

Several types from the same trait can be imported in one attribute using a braced list, and each entry may be renamed with `as` or constrained with `=`. The braced form `#[use_type(HasFooType.{Foo, Bar as Baz})]` imports `Foo` under its own name and `Bar` under the local alias `Baz`. The equality form `#[use_type(HasScalarType.{Scalar = f64})]` imports `Scalar` and additionally constrains it, emitting `Self: HasScalarType<Scalar = f64>` in the `where` clause. A braced list may itself carry a foreign context — `#[use_type(HasFooType.{Foo, Bar} in Ctx)]` projects every imported type in the group against `Ctx`, since the `in` clause scopes over the whole spec, not a single entry.

When a definition imports types from several traits at once, prefer combining them into a single `#[use_type]` attribute by separating the trait paths with commas — `#[use_type(HasUserIdType.UserId, HasCurrencyType.Currency, HasErrorType.Error)]` — since one attribute reads as a single import list. Stacking several `#[use_type]` attributes on one item behaves identically, because the host collects every attribute's specs into one list before resolving any of them: writing `#[use_type(HasFooType.{Foo = Vec<Bar>})]` above `#[use_type(HasBarType.Bar)]` gives exactly what the combined form gives, an alias imported by one attribute being available to another. Reach for a second attribute only when a real reason calls for it rather than as the default.

Three restrictions guard against imports the macro cannot lower unambiguously. No two imports may resolve to the same bare identifier or alias — whether they appear in different specs or in the same braced list, and on `#[cgp_component]` as well as on `#[cgp_fn]` and `#[cgp_impl]` — because the substitution could then only pick one and would silently drop the rest; a collision is a compile error. The `= ...` type-equality form is rejected on `#[cgp_component]` specifically, because a trait definition cannot carry the impl-side equality constraint the equality form produces; equality constraints belong on `#[cgp_fn]` and `#[cgp_impl]`, where they become `where` bounds. And the imports' own contexts and trait arguments may not resolve through one another in a **cycle**, since a cycle leaves no order in which to resolve them; that too is a compile error, described under [Expansion](#expansion) below.

## Syntax Grammar

The grammar below covers the tokens inside `#[use_type(...)]` — the comma-separated list of import specs, not the surrounding attribute delimiters.

```ebnf
UseTypeArgs -> UseTypeSpec (`,` UseTypeSpec)* `,`?

UseTypeSpec -> TraitPath `.` TypeItems (`in` ContextPath)?

ContextPath -> TypePath
TraitPath   -> TypePath

TypeItems -> UseTypeIdent
           | `{` UseTypeIdent (`,` UseTypeIdent)* `,`? `}`

UseTypeIdent -> IDENTIFIER (`as` IDENTIFIER)? (`=` Type)?
```

`ContextPath` and `TraitPath` are ordinary Rust `TypePath`s (a path whose final segment may carry angle-bracketed generic arguments); their `::` segments belong to the path, while the `.` after the trait starts the associated-type list. An omitted `in ContextPath` clause defaults the rewrite target to `Self`; because `in` is a reserved keyword it can never appear inside `TypeItems`, so it marks the context clause unambiguously. In each `UseTypeIdent`, the leading `IDENTIFIER` is the associated type's own name, an `as` clause gives it a local alias to write in the signature, and an `= Type` clause pins it with an equality bound (accepted on `#[cgp_fn]` and `#[cgp_impl]`, rejected on `#[cgp_component]`).

## Expansion

`#[use_type]` runs before the rest of the macro in three steps: it first *grounds* each import's own type positions (resolving an `in Context`, or a trait argument, that names another import into a fully-qualified path), then substitutes every matching bare type identifier with the qualified associated type in one pass, and finally adds the trait as a supertrait or bound. Consider this `#[cgp_fn]` using the single-import form:

```rust
pub trait HasScalarType {
    type Scalar: Clone + Mul<Output = Self::Scalar>;
}

#[cgp_fn]
#[use_type(HasScalarType.Scalar)]
fn rectangle_area(
    &self,
    #[implicit] width: Scalar,
    #[implicit] height: Scalar,
) -> Scalar {
    width * height
}
```

The macro first rewrites every standalone `Scalar` to `<Self as HasScalarType>::Scalar` and appends `HasScalarType` to the bounds, then desugars the resulting `#[cgp_fn]` as usual. The effective expansion is:

```rust
pub trait RectangleArea: HasScalarType {
    fn rectangle_area(&self) -> <Self as HasScalarType>::Scalar;
}

impl<Context> RectangleArea for Context
where
    Self: HasField<Symbol!("width"), Value = <Self as HasScalarType>::Scalar>
        + HasField<Symbol!("height"), Value = <Self as HasScalarType>::Scalar>,
    Self: HasScalarType,
{
    fn rectangle_area(&self) -> <Self as HasScalarType>::Scalar {
        let width: <Self as HasScalarType>::Scalar =
            self.get_field(PhantomData::<Symbol!("width")>).clone();
        let height: <Self as HasScalarType>::Scalar =
            self.get_field(PhantomData::<Symbol!("height")>).clone();
        width * height
    }
}
```

The substitution is purely textual: it matches single-segment type paths with no arguments whose identifier equals the imported name (or its alias), and replaces them with `<Self as HasScalarType>::Scalar`. A bare `Scalar` anywhere — return type, implicit-argument annotation, `where` predicate, or a `let` binding inside the body — is rewritten the same way, which is what makes nested uses work without the author writing any path.

The rewrite also reaches an alias that *qualifies* an expression path, so the alias means one thing throughout the definition rather than only in type positions. `Transaction::begin_from(pool)` becomes `<<Self as HasTransactionType>::Transaction>::begin_from(pool)` — the qualified-type form, since `<Self as Trait>::Assoc::method` is not valid syntax — and an associated const reads the same way. The one position left alone is a **bare, single-segment** alias in expression position: that names a *value*, which an abstract type can never be, so an alias sharing its name with a unit struct the body constructs still resolves to the struct. In short, an alias in a type position or as a path qualifier is the abstract type; an alias standing alone as an expression is whatever value that name denotes.

Because the rewrite fires only on the bare identifier of an *imported* type, a construct's own **local associated types must always stay qualified as `Self::Assoc`** and are left untouched. A `#[cgp_component]` trait or a `#[cgp_impl]` provider that declares its own `type Output` refers to it as `Self::Output`, never as a bare `Output`, precisely because `Output` is the construct's own type rather than one imported from another trait — `#[use_type]` neither imports it nor rewrites it, and it should not be listed in a `#[use_type]` attribute. This is why a mixed signature such as `Result<Self::Output, Error>` is correct and idiomatic: the local `Self::Output` stays qualified while the imported foreign type `Error` (from `#[use_type(HasErrorType.Error)]`) is written bare. Attempting to write the local type bare would leave a `Output` identifier that resolves to nothing, since the substitution pass has no entry for it.

For `#[cgp_component]`, the trait is added as a supertrait rather than a `where` bound, and the rewrite touches the trait's own signatures. Starting from:

```rust
#[cgp_component(AreaCalculator)]
#[use_type(HasScalarType.Scalar)]
pub trait CanCalculateArea {
    fn area(&self) -> Scalar;
}
```

the `#[use_type]` phase rewrites the trait into the following before `#[cgp_component]` proceeds:

```rust
#[cgp_component(AreaCalculator)]
pub trait CanCalculateArea: HasScalarType {
    fn area(&self) -> <Self as HasScalarType>::Scalar;
}
```

The supertrait is added only when the rewrite target is `Self`. With the foreign-type `in Context` form the target is a named type, so the bound cannot be a supertrait of `Self`; instead the macro adds a plain `Context: Trait` predicate wherever the substituted `<Context as Trait>::Assoc` paths appear. On `#[cgp_fn]` and `#[cgp_impl]` that predicate lands in the impl's `where` clause, and on `#[cgp_component]` and `#[cgp_fn]` it is *also* added to the generated trait's own `where` clause — because the trait's signatures now name `<Context as Trait>::Assoc` and would not be well-formed without it. This means a component using the `in` form does not have to declare the parameter's bound by hand; writing `pub trait CanCalculateArea<Types>` is enough, and `Types: HasScalarType` is supplied for you. (The type-equality `= T` pin, by contrast, stays impl-side and is never added to the trait.) This `#[cgp_fn]` imports `Scalar` from a generic parameter `Types`:

```rust
#[cgp_fn]
#[use_type(HasScalarType.Scalar in Types)]
pub fn rectangle_area<Types>(
    &self,
    #[implicit] width: Scalar,
    #[implicit] height: Scalar,
) -> Scalar
where
    Scalar: Mul<Output = Scalar> + Copy,
{
    let res: Scalar = width * height;
    res
}
```

Every `Scalar`, including the ones in the explicit `where` clause, expands to `<Types as HasScalarType>::Scalar`, and the bound `Types: HasScalarType` is added to *both* the generated trait's `where` clause and the impl's — so the plain, unbounded `<Types>` the author wrote is enough. It is a `where` bound rather than a supertrait because the target is a named type, not `Self`:

```rust
pub trait RectangleArea<Types>
where
    Types: HasScalarType,
{
    fn rectangle_area(&self) -> <Types as HasScalarType>::Scalar;
}

impl<Context, Types> RectangleArea<Types> for Context
where
    <Types as HasScalarType>::Scalar:
        Mul<Output = <Types as HasScalarType>::Scalar> + Copy,
    Self: HasField<Symbol!("width"), Value = <Types as HasScalarType>::Scalar>
        + HasField<Symbol!("height"), Value = <Types as HasScalarType>::Scalar>,
    Types: HasScalarType,
{
    fn rectangle_area(&self) -> <Types as HasScalarType>::Scalar {
        let width: <Types as HasScalarType>::Scalar =
            self.get_field(PhantomData::<Symbol!("width")>).clone();
        let height: <Types as HasScalarType>::Scalar =
            self.get_field(PhantomData::<Symbol!("height")>).clone();
        let res: <Types as HasScalarType>::Scalar = width * height;
        res
    }
}
```

The type-equality form adds a constrained bound on top of the substitution. Writing `#[use_type(HasScalarType.{Scalar = f64})]` substitutes `Scalar` to `<Self as HasScalarType>::Scalar` exactly as before, but emits `Self: HasScalarType<Scalar = f64>` in the `where` clause in place of the plain `Self: HasScalarType`, pinning the abstract type to `f64`. When the imported trait is itself generic, the pin joins the arguments the trait path already carries rather than following them as a second group, so `#[use_type(HasFooType<u8>.{Foo = u32})]` emits `Self: HasFooType<u8, Foo = u32>` — the only spelling Rust accepts for a bound that both instantiates a trait and pins its associated type.

The right-hand side is itself substituted, so an imported alias is grounded **wherever it occurs inside it**. When the target *is* another import's alias — as in `#[use_type(HasBarType.{Bar as Baz = Foo}, HasFooType.Foo)]` — the macro emits `Self: HasBarType<Bar = <Self as HasFooType>::Foo>`, tying the two abstract types together. When the target merely *mentions* one, the alias is grounded in place: `#[use_type(HasDbType.Db, HasTransactionType.{Transaction = Tx<Db>})]` emits `Self: HasTransactionType<Transaction = Tx<<Self as HasDbType>::Db>>`, and an alias inside a qualified path is grounded the same way (`{Transaction = <Db as Database>::Transaction}` becomes `<<Self as HasDbType>::Db as Database>::Transaction`). This cross-spec resolution relies on aliases being unique, which the duplicate check described in the Syntax section guarantees. The one name not substituted in a pin's right-hand side is the pinned alias itself, so a self-pin such as `{Foo = Foo}` is rejected as an unresolved name rather than accepted as a bound that says nothing.

Grounding reaches a trait path's own generic arguments as well as an `in Context` clause, since both end up inside the emitted `<Context as Trait<Args…>>::Assoc` path. So an alias may parameterize the trait it is imported *from*: `#[use_type(HasDbType.Db, HasPoolType<Db>.Pool)]` grounds the second import's argument and projects against `HasPoolType<<Self as HasDbType>::Db>`, in the rewritten signature and in the added supertrait alike. This composes with the pin form, so `#[use_type(HasDbType.Db, HasPoolType<Db>.{Pool = u32})]` emits `Self: HasPoolType<<Self as HasDbType>::Db, Pool = u32>`.

**Nothing about the resolution depends on the order the imports are written in.** Each spec is resolved against the specs it *depends on*, never against the ones that happen to precede it, so every arrangement of the same imports yields the same substitutions and the same bounds — the only thing source order decides is the order those bounds are listed in. That holds across a chain, a pin whose right-hand side names an alias declared after it, and specs split across stacked attributes alike. Concretely: `#[use_type(HasC.C in B, HasB.B in A, HasA.A)]` grounds identically to the front-to-back `#[use_type(HasA.A, HasB.B in A, HasC.C in B)]`, and two imports may share one context (`#[use_type(HasA.A, HasB.B in A, HasC.C in A)]`) as readily as chain through it. The one arrangement without a valid order is a **cycle** — positions that resolve through each other, as in `#[use_type(HasA.A in B, HasB.B in A)]`, or the degenerate `#[use_type(HasAType.A in A)]`. A cycle is rejected at macro time with the caret on the alias that closes the loop and a message naming the cycle (`` `B` -> `A` -> `B` ``); correct the imports so the positions form an acyclic chain, and any acyclic order will do.

## Examples

A realistic use threads one abstract `Scalar` type through a component and a provider, with neither writing `Self::` by hand. The component and the type trait come first:

```rust
use cgp::prelude::*;
use core::ops::Mul;

#[cgp_type]
pub trait HasScalarType {
    type Scalar: Clone + Mul<Output = Self::Scalar>;
}

#[cgp_component(AreaCalculator)]
#[use_type(HasScalarType.Scalar)]
pub trait CanCalculateArea {
    fn area(&self) -> Scalar;
}
```

`CanCalculateArea` ends up with `HasScalarType` as a supertrait and `area` returning `<Self as HasScalarType>::Scalar`. A provider for it imports the same type and writes its body in terms of the bare name:

```rust
#[cgp_impl(new RectangleArea)]
#[use_type(HasScalarType.Scalar)]
impl AreaCalculator {
    fn area(&self, #[implicit] width: Scalar, #[implicit] height: Scalar) -> Scalar {
        width * height
    }
}
```

The provider's `#[use_type]` adds `Self: HasScalarType` to its `where` clause and rewrites each `Scalar` to the qualified path, so the implicit `width` and `height` fields and the return value all agree on the context's chosen scalar type. A concrete context then wires `HasScalarType` to a concrete type with `UseType<f64>` and supplies the fields, and `area()` works without any reference to associated-type syntax in the user's own code.

## Related constructs

`#[use_type]` is most often paired with [`#[cgp_type]`](../macros/cgp_type.md), which defines the abstract type trait it imports, and with the [`UseType` provider](../providers/use_type.md), which a context uses to bind that abstract type to a concrete one. It applies to all three implementation macros — [`#[cgp_fn]`](../macros/cgp_fn.md), [`#[cgp_impl]`](../macros/cgp_impl.md), and [`#[cgp_component]`](../macros/cgp_component.md) — adjusting whether it emits a supertrait or a `where` bound based on which it annotates. It overlaps in role with [`#[extend]`](extend.md), which adds a supertrait bound without rewriting type identifiers; `#[use_type]` is preferred when the imported type is actually mentioned in signatures, since it also performs the substitution. The abstract type itself is read through [`HasType`](../components/has_type.md) at the provider level.

- Parsing: the attribute is parsed by `UseTypeAttribute` in [crates/macros/cgp-macro-core/src/types/attributes/use_type/attribute.rs](https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp/blob/main/crates/macros/cgp-macro-core/src/types/attributes/use_type/attribute.rs), which reads the trait as a `PathWithTypeArgs`, the associated-type list after the `.`, and an optional `in Context` (also a `PathWithTypeArgs`). Per-type entries (`as` alias and `=` equality) are in `ident.rs`.
- Three-step transform (resolve the imports, substitute, add bounds): the entry points live in `attributes.rs`. `ground_specs` in `grounding.rs` resolves each `in Context` or trait argument that names another import into a fully-qualified path, grounding each spec against its dependencies and rejecting a cyclic import list in the same walk; `transform_item_trait` then substitutes and adds bounds to a trait (a supertrait for a `Self` import, a `where` bound for a foreign `in` import — this is `#[cgp_component]` and `#[cgp_fn]`), and `transform_item_impl` does the same for an impl's `where` clause. Both reject a shared identifier or alias first via `forbid_duplicate_aliases`, and the impl-side type-equality predicates are derived in `type_predicates.rs`.
