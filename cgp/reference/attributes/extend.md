# `#[extend(...)]`

`#[extend(...)]` adds the given trait bounds as supertraits of the generated trait, making them a public part of the trait's interface rather than a hidden impl-side dependency.

## Purpose

`#[extend(...)]` exists to add supertraits to a CGP trait through an import-like attribute, and in [`#[cgp_fn]`](../macros/cgp_fn.md) it is the only way to do so. A supertrait is a bound that every implementor of a trait must also satisfy, and that every user of the trait may rely on. In `#[cgp_fn]`, the `where` clauses written in the function body are treated as impl-side dependencies and deliberately kept out of the generated trait definition — so there is no place to write a supertrait by hand. `#[extend(...)]` fills that gap: the bounds it lists are promoted onto the trait itself.

The distinction from [`#[uses]`](uses.md) is the whole point. Both attributes accept the same trait-bound syntax and both feel like imports, but they import into different places. `#[uses(...)]` adds a hidden `Self` bound to the impl only — a private dependency that callers never see. `#[extend(...)]` adds a supertrait to the trait — a public requirement that becomes part of the contract. The natural way to describe the pair is that `#[extend(...)]` is the `pub use` equivalent of `#[uses(...)]`: where `#[uses(...)]` imports a capability for the implementation's own use, `#[extend(...)]` re-exports it as part of what the trait guarantees.

This framing also explains which supertraits `#[extend(...)]` is for and why it is the preferred way to declare them. `#[extend(...)]` is the tool for a **non-type capability supertrait** — a trait like `HasName` or `CanCalculateArea` that a component depends on but whose associated types it does not name in its own signatures. In [`#[cgp_component]`](../macros/cgp_component.md), prefer `#[extend(HasName)]` over the native `pub trait CanGreet: HasName` form: the native `:` syntax reads as inheritance to programmers coming from object-oriented languages, suggesting an is-a relationship to a parent class that a CGP component does not have, whereas `#[extend(...)]` reads as importing a capability the trait re-exports — which is what a CGP supertrait actually is. When the supertrait is instead an **abstract-type component** whose associated type the signatures reference — such as [`HasErrorType`](../components/has_error_type.md) through its `Error` — prefer [`#[use_type]`](use_type.md), which adds the supertrait *and* rewrites the bare type; `#[use_type]` is the recommended form for abstract-type components. In [`#[cgp_fn]`](../macros/cgp_fn.md), where direct supertrait syntax is unavailable because the body's `where` clauses are impl-side dependencies, `#[extend(...)]` is the only mechanism for a plain capability supertrait.

## Syntax

`#[extend(...)]` takes a comma-separated list of trait bounds in the simplified form `TraitIdent<ParamA, ParamB, ...>`:

```rust
#[extend(HasScalarType)]
```

Each entry names a trait that becomes a supertrait of the generated trait, optionally with generic type arguments. A bare `HasScalarType` becomes a `: HasScalarType` supertrait; a parameterized form carries its arguments through. Multiple bounds may be listed in one attribute or spread across several `#[extend(...)]` attributes, and they accumulate.

`#[extend(...)]` is accepted in [`#[cgp_fn]`](../macros/cgp_fn.md), in [`#[cgp_component]`](../macros/cgp_component.md), and in the macros built on it, [`#[cgp_type]`](../macros/cgp_type.md), [`#[cgp_getter]`](../macros/cgp_getter.md), and [`#[cgp_auto_getter]`](../macros/cgp_auto_getter.md), which run the same attribute collector. It is not available in [`#[cgp_impl]`](../macros/cgp_impl.md), because a provider impl has no trait definition of its own to attach supertraits to — the supertraits belong to the component's trait, defined by `#[cgp_component]`.

## Syntax Grammar

The attribute argument of `#[extend]` is a comma-separated list of bounds:

```ebnf
ExtendArgs -> TypeParamBound ( `,` TypeParamBound )* `,`?
```

This is the same production [`#[uses]`](uses.md) accepts, and the same Rust `TypeParamBound`, so a lifetime, a `?Sized`, or an associated-type equality parses as readily as a plain trait name. The list may be empty and the attribute may be repeated, with every occurrence's entries collected together. The two attributes differ in where the collected bounds land, not in what they accept.

## Expansion

`#[extend(...)]` adds each listed bound as a supertrait of the generated trait, and the same bound also appears in the impl's `where` clause so the implementation may rely on it. The example below uses the abstract-type trait `HasScalarType` to make the two-placement behavior visible in one signature; in production, an abstract-type supertrait like this is better declared with [`#[use_type]`](use_type.md), and `#[extend(...)]` is reserved for a non-type capability supertrait. Starting from a `#[cgp_fn]` definition that depends on an abstract `Scalar` type:

```rust
pub trait HasScalarType {
    type Scalar: Clone + Mul<Output = Self::Scalar>;
}

#[cgp_fn]
#[extend(HasScalarType)]
fn rectangle_area(
    &self,
    #[implicit] width: Self::Scalar,
    #[implicit] height: Self::Scalar,
) -> Self::Scalar {
    width * height
}
```

the macro emits a trait carrying `HasScalarType` as a supertrait, and an impl that carries both `Self: HasScalarType` and the `HasField` bounds from the implicit arguments:

```rust
pub trait RectangleArea: HasScalarType {
    fn rectangle_area(&self) -> Self::Scalar;
}

impl<Context> RectangleArea for Context
where
    Self: HasScalarType,
    Self: HasField<Symbol!("width"), Value = Self::Scalar>
        + HasField<Symbol!("height"), Value = Self::Scalar>,
{
    fn rectangle_area(&self) -> Self::Scalar {
        let width: Self::Scalar =
            self.get_field(PhantomData::<Symbol!("width")>).clone();
        let height: Self::Scalar =
            self.get_field(PhantomData::<Symbol!("height")>).clone();

        width * height
    }
}
```

The bound appears in two places for a reason. On the trait it is a supertrait, so `Self::Scalar` resolves and callers know any `RectangleArea` type is also a `HasScalarType`. In the impl `where` clause it lets the implementation actually use the associated type. This double placement is the difference from [`#[uses]`](uses.md), which adds the bound to the impl only. The generated context type is named `__Context__` in the real output; `Context` is used here for readability.

In [`#[cgp_component]`](../macros/cgp_component.md) the effect is purely on the consumer trait, and it is exactly equivalent to writing the supertrait directly. The definition

```rust
#[cgp_component(AreaCalculator)]
#[extend(HasScalarType)]
pub trait CanCalculateArea {
    fn area(&self) -> Self::Scalar;
}
```

is the same as `pub trait CanCalculateArea: HasScalarType`. Although `#[extend(...)]` generates nothing the language cannot already spell here, it is still the preferred way to write the supertrait: it presents the bound as an import rather than as OOP-style inheritance, and it keeps the `use`/`pub use` pairing with `#[uses(...)]` reading consistently across both macros.

## Examples

`#[extend(...)]` shines when a `#[cgp_fn]` capability depends on an abstract type that the context must provide. The function below works for any context that defines a `Scalar` type and supplies `width` and `height` fields of that type:

```rust
use cgp::prelude::*;
use core::ops::Mul;

pub trait HasScalarType {
    type Scalar: Clone + Mul<Output = Self::Scalar>;
}

#[cgp_fn]
#[extend(HasScalarType)]
pub fn rectangle_area(
    &self,
    #[implicit] width: Self::Scalar,
    #[implicit] height: Self::Scalar,
) -> Self::Scalar {
    width * height
}

#[derive(HasField)]
pub struct Rectangle {
    pub width: f64,
    pub height: f64,
}

impl HasScalarType for Rectangle {
    type Scalar = f64;
}
```

Because `HasScalarType` is a supertrait of `RectangleArea`, the abstract `Self::Scalar` is usable in the signature and body, and `Rectangle` — which implements `HasScalarType` with `Scalar = f64` and derives `HasField` for its two fields — satisfies every bound, gaining `rectangle_area`.

## Related constructs

`#[extend(...)]` is the `pub use` counterpart to [`#[uses]`](uses.md): the two share syntax but differ in placement, with `#[extend(...)]` adding public supertraits and `#[uses(...)]` adding hidden impl-side bounds. It is used in [`#[cgp_fn]`](../macros/cgp_fn.md), where it is the only way to declare supertraits, and in [`#[cgp_component]`](../macros/cgp_component.md), where it is the preferred alternative to native supertrait syntax because it reads as an import rather than as OOP-style inheritance. When the supertrait is an abstract-type trait whose associated type is referenced throughout the signature, prefer [`#[use_type]`](use_type.md), which adds the supertrait *and* rewrites bare type names into fully-qualified form. To add `where` clauses (not supertraits) to a `#[cgp_fn]` trait definition, use [`#[extend_where]`](extend_where.md).
