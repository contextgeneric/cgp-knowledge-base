# `#[cgp_namespace]`

`cgp_namespace!` defines a *namespace* — a reusable, named lookup table that maps component keys to providers — so that a concrete context can inherit a whole group of wirings at once and still override individual entries.

## Purpose

`cgp_namespace!` exists to make groups of component wirings reusable across contexts. With [`delegate_components!`](delegate_components.md) alone, every context spells out its own table entry by entry; two contexts that should share the same wiring must repeat it. A namespace lifts that table out of any single context and gives it a name, turning "this exact set of providers" into a thing other contexts can refer to and build on.

The mechanism that makes this work is a layer of indirection between a context's delegation table and the actual providers. A namespace is not itself a context; it is a trait (named after the namespace) carrying a `Delegate` associated type, implemented per key. A context that opts into a namespace forwards every lookup through that trait, so the namespace's entries become the context's defaults. The forwarding is keyed by a *path* — a type-level list of symbols and component names — rather than by a bare component name, which is what lets one namespace inherit from another and lets a context shadow a single inherited entry without disturbing the rest.

The payoff is preset-style configuration with selective override. A context can say "use everything in this namespace" and then add a handful of its own entries that win over the inherited ones, because a directly-wired entry on the context resolves before the namespace fallback is consulted. This is the same inheritance-with-override pattern presets rely on, expressed entirely through the trait system with no runtime cost.

## Syntax

`cgp_namespace!` is a function-like macro whose body resembles a `delegate_components!` table with an optional namespace header. The simplest form defines a fresh namespace with `new` and lists entries that map component keys to redirect paths:

```rust
cgp_namespace! {
    new MyNamespace {
        FooProviderComponent =>
            @MyFooComponent,
    }
}
```

The `new` keyword tells the macro to also emit the namespace's marker struct and its lookup trait; omit it only when those are already declared elsewhere. `MyNamespace` is the namespace name, which becomes both a trait and (with `new`) a backing struct. The entries inside the braces are the namespace's wiring.

Two distinct entry forms appear in the body, and they generate different table contents. A `=>` entry redirects a key to a path: `FooProviderComponent => @MyFooComponent` says "when this namespace is asked for `FooProviderComponent`, look up the path `@MyFooComponent` instead." A `:` entry maps a key directly to a provider, as in `delegate_components!`: `[String, u64]: ShowWithDisplay` makes the namespace resolve those keys straight to the `ShowWithDisplay` provider. Paths written with the `@` sigil — `@MyFooComponent`, `@app.ErrorRaiserComponent`, `@cgp.core.error` — are dotted sequences of symbols and type names that desugar into type-level path lists.

A namespace can inherit from a parent namespace by naming it after a colon in the header:

```rust
cgp_namespace! {
    new ExtendedNamespace: DefaultNamespace {
        @cgp.core.error =>
            @app,
    }
}
```

Here `ExtendedNamespace` inherits every entry of `DefaultNamespace` and additionally rewrites the `@cgp.core.error` path prefix to `@app`. The parent may itself be parameterized (it is parsed as a path with type arguments), and the entries in the child body layer on top of the inherited ones.

Defining a namespace is only half of the pattern; a context joins a namespace through `delegate_components!` using a `namespace` header line, and individual components attach to a namespace through the `#[prefix(...)]` attribute on their trait. Those two constructs are where namespaces are consumed, and both are shown under Expansion and Examples below.

### The shared body grammar, and what differs here

**`cgp_namespace!` parses its body with the same code [`delegate_components!`](delegate_components.md) uses, so every syntax that macro accepts is accepted here too** — the three mapping operators (`:`, `->`, `=>`), the three key forms (a single key, a bracketed [list key](delegate_components.md#keys-a-single-name-a-list-or-a-path), an `@`-path key with its `[…]` and `{…}` grouping forms), per-key generics, the nested-table value form, and the three leading statements (`open`, `namespace`, `for`). Read that macro's Syntax section for the grammar of each; what follows is only what *differs* here.

What differs is the item each entry lowers to. A `delegate_components!` entry emits `impl DelegateComponent<Key> for TargetType`, keyed on the component and implemented for the context; a `cgp_namespace!` entry emits `impl Namespace<__Table__> for Key`, implemented **for the key** and generic over whatever table later consults it. So an entry here answers "where should a lookup for this key go next", not "which provider does this context use", and that difference decides which of the shared forms are worth writing.

The two forms that carry the namespace's meaning are the ones above: `=>` states a route and `:` binds a provider. The rest are legal and rarely what a namespace wants. A `->` mapping still projects through the *value's* `DelegateComponent` table rather than through the namespace, so it names a concrete table inside what is meant to be a table-generic definition. An `open Component;` statement is accepted and generates exactly the entry `Component => @Component,` would, which is occasionally a convenient spelling for rooting a component's route at its own name. A `namespace Other;` statement is accepted and emits a forwarding impl, but inheritance is written with the `: ParentNamespace` header instead — that is the form the parent chain, its overrides, and the cycle diagnostics under Known issues are all defined in terms of.

One shared form parses here and then fails to compile, so it is worth naming rather than leaving to be discovered. The nested-table value `Wrapper<new Inner { … }>` is accepted by the parser and the macro substitutes `Wrapper<Inner>` as the entry's `Delegate`, but `cgp_namespace!` never lifts the inner table out — unlike `delegate_components!`, its evaluation emits only the namespace trait, its struct, and one impl per entry — so the `Inner` struct and its `DelegateComponent` impls are never generated at all:

```rust
cgp_namespace! {
    new NestedNs {
        FooProviderComponent:
            UseDelegate<new FooTable {
                String: DummyFoo,
            }>,
    }
}
```

```text
error[E0425]: cannot find type `FooTable` in this scope
```

The message names the missing table rather than the unsupported form, so it reads as a typo. Declare the inner table in its own `delegate_components! { new FooTable { … } }` block and bind the namespace key to `UseDelegate<FooTable>`, or — better, since the nested-table form is legacy either way — leave per-type dispatch to the context, as [`delegate_components!`](delegate_components.md) describes.

## Syntax Grammar

The body of `cgp_namespace!` is an optional generic list and `new` keyword, a namespace name, an optional parent namespace, and a brace-delimited table:

```ebnf
CgpNamespace    -> Generics? `new`? NamespaceName ( `:` ParentNamespace )? `{` NamespaceBody `}`

NamespaceName   -> IDENTIFIER GenericArgs?
ParentNamespace -> TypePath GenericArgs?

NamespaceBody   -> Statement* ( Mapping ( `,` Mapping )* `,`? )?
```

**`NamespaceBody` is [`delegate_components!`](delegate_components.md)'s `TableBody` production unchanged**, so its `Statement` and `Mapping` productions — every operator, every key form including the grouped `@`-paths, and every value form — are that macro's and are defined there rather than restated here. The two forms a namespace normally uses are the `` `=>` `` redirect to an `@`-`Path` and the `` `:` `` bind to a provider; the Syntax section above says what the others do here and which one fails to compile. The `` `:` `` between `NamespaceName` and `ParentNamespace` is the inheritance colon, distinct from a mapping's `:`. `NamespaceName` is an identifier with optional generic arguments (it becomes both a trait and, with `new`, a struct); `ParentNamespace` is a type path that may itself be parameterized.

Two of the three statement forms in that shared production are owned here rather than there, because they exist to join a context's table to a namespace:

```ebnf
NamespaceStmt -> `namespace` IDENTIFIER `;`

ForStmt       -> `for` `<` IDENTIFIER `,` IDENTIFIER `>` `in` TypePath WhereClause?
                 `{` ( NormalMapping ( `,` NormalMapping )* `,`? )? `}`
```

A `NamespaceStmt` forwards every lookup on the table through the named namespace. A `ForStmt` binds a key variable and a provider variable, reads each entry of the table named after `in`, and emits one mapping per entry — its body admits only the `` `:` `` form, which is why [`delegate_components!`](delegate_components.md) names that `NormalMapping` separately, and its `Key` and `ProviderValue` are that macro's shared productions. Its optional `WhereClause` is merged into every impl the loop generates, so a bound written there (`for <T, P> in Table where T: Clone { … }`) constrains which keys the loop wires, alongside the namespace bound the loop reconstructs. The third statement form, `OpenStmt`, is owned by [`delegate_components!`](delegate_components.md) because that is where it is written; it parses in a namespace body too, where it is another spelling of a `` `=>` `` entry. `TypePath` and `WhereClause` are Rust grammar productions.

Like [`delegate_components!`](delegate_components.md), the body accepts no attributes on any entry — on a mapping key, a `=>` redirect key, or a key inside a `for` loop — and rejects any it finds with a spanned "unsupported attribute" error rather than silently discarding it.

## Expansion

`cgp_namespace!` emits, in order, an optional marker struct, an optional lookup trait, and one `impl` of that trait per entry (plus one inheritance `impl` when a parent is named). Take the `new` namespace with a single redirect entry:

```rust
cgp_namespace! {
    new MyNamespace {
        FooProviderComponent =>
            @MyFooComponent,
    }
}
```

Because `new` is present, the macro first emits a backing struct whose name is the namespace name wrapped in `__…Components`, then the lookup trait. The trait carries the table's generic `__Table__` parameter and a single `Delegate` associated type:

```rust
pub struct __MyNamespaceComponents;

pub trait MyNamespace<__Table__> {
    type Delegate;
}
```

Each `=>` entry becomes an `impl` of that trait for the entry's key, whose `Delegate` is a [`RedirectLookup`](../providers/redirect_lookup.md) pointing the table at the entry's path. The `@MyFooComponent` path desugars into a `PathCons<…, Nil>` type-level list:

```rust
impl<__Table__> MyNamespace<__Table__> for FooProviderComponent {
    type Delegate = RedirectLookup<__Table__, PathCons<MyFooComponent, Nil>>;
}
```

Reading this back: `MyNamespace<__Table__>::Delegate` for the key `FooProviderComponent` is "look up the path `MyFooComponent` inside whatever table `__Table__` is." `RedirectLookup<Components, Path>` is a CGP-defined provider that resolves by delegating `Components` along `Path`; the namespace never names a concrete provider for this key, it only re-routes the lookup, so the actual provider is decided wherever the path eventually lands.

A `:` entry instead maps the key directly to the named provider, with no `RedirectLookup` indirection. From the array form `[String, u64]: ShowWithDisplay`, the macro emits one `impl` per key:

```rust
impl<__Table__> DefaultShowComponents<__Table__> for String {
    type Delegate = ShowWithDisplay;
}
impl<__Table__> DefaultShowComponents<__Table__> for u64 {
    type Delegate = ShowWithDisplay;
}
```

When a parent namespace is named, the macro prepends one extra blanket `impl` that forwards unmatched keys to the parent. For `new ExtendedNamespace: DefaultNamespace { … }`, the inherited entries arrive through this impl:

```rust
impl<__Table__, __Key__, __Value__> ExtendedNamespace<__Table__> for __Key__
where
    __Key__: DefaultNamespace<__ExtendedNamespaceComponents>,
    __Key__: DefaultNamespace<__Table__, Delegate = __Value__>,
{
    type Delegate = __Value__;
}
```

This says: for any `__Key__` the parent `DefaultNamespace` resolves, `ExtendedNamespace` resolves it to the same `__Value__`. The body entries of the child are emitted after this blanket impl and take precedence where their keys are more specific. The path-rewriting entry `@cgp.core.error => @app` becomes an impl keyed on the `cgp.core.error` path prefix whose `Delegate` is a `RedirectLookup` onto the `@app` prefix — rerouting an entire subtree of the parent's namespace rather than a single component.

The other half of the pattern is what attaches a component to a namespace, via the `#[prefix(...)]` attribute on the component's trait. Given:

```rust
#[cgp_component(BarProvider)]
#[prefix(@MyBarComponent in MyNamespace)]
pub trait Bar {
    fn bar(&self);
}
```

`#[cgp_component]` emits its usual items, and `#[prefix]` adds one extra impl that registers `BarProviderComponent` into `MyNamespace` under the prefix path `@MyBarComponent`:

```rust
impl<__Components__> MyNamespace<__Components__> for BarProviderComponent {
    type Delegate = RedirectLookup<
        __Components__,
        PathCons<MyBarComponent, PathCons<BarProviderComponent, Nil>>,
    >;
}
```

So `MyNamespace`, asked for `BarProviderComponent`, redirects the lookup to the path `MyBarComponent → BarProviderComponent`. A component may carry several `#[prefix]` attributes to register itself into several namespaces at once.

Two details of the expansion are worth holding onto. The table parameter is literally named `__Table__` and the inheritance blanket impl uses `__Key__`/`__Value__`; the examples keep those names because they appear verbatim in compiler errors. And every path under `@` becomes a `PathCons`/`Symbol`/`Chars` type-level list — `@my_app.MyFooComponent` expands to `PathCons<Symbol<6, Chars<'m', …>>, PathCons<MyFooComponent, Nil>>`, with dotted lowercase segments becoming `Symbol` string literals and capitalized segments becoming the named type.

## Examples

A namespace becomes useful once a context joins it and overrides part of it. Start with a namespace that supplies default per-type providers, defined with `new`:

```rust
use cgp::prelude::*;

cgp_namespace! {
    new DefaultShowComponents {
        [String, u64]: ShowWithDisplay,
    }
}
```

A context then opts into a namespace inside `delegate_components!` with a `namespace` header line, and may add its own entries that win over the namespace defaults. Joining `DefaultNamespace` and pulling defaults in through a `for` loop over `DefaultShowComponents`:

```rust
pub struct AppB;

delegate_components! {
    AppB {
        namespace DefaultNamespace;

        for <T, Provider> in DefaultShowComponents {
            @test.ShowImplComponent.T: Provider,
        }
    }
}
```

The `namespace DefaultNamespace;` line makes `AppB` forward every component lookup through `DefaultNamespace<AppB>`, and the `for … in DefaultShowComponents` block wires `AppB`'s `ShowImplComponent` entries by reading `DefaultShowComponents`'s `Delegate` for each type `T`. To override a single entry, a later direct line on the same context simply names a different provider for that key; because the context's own entry resolves before the namespace fallback, it shadows the inherited one without touching the others:

```rust
delegate_components! {
    AppA {
        namespace DefaultNamespace;

        for <T, Provider> in DefaultImpls1<ShowImplComponent> {
            @test.ShowImplComponent.T: Provider,
        }

        @test.ShowImplComponent.u64:
            ShowWithDisplay,   // overrides the inherited entry for u64
    }
}
```

Inheritance composes the same way at the namespace level: `ExtendedNamespace: DefaultNamespace` produces a namespace that resolves everything `DefaultNamespace` does, plus the child's own entries, and any context joining `ExtendedNamespace` gets the merged result.

## Related constructs

`cgp_namespace!` sits between component definitions and context wiring, so it relates to constructs on both sides. [`#[cgp_component]`](cgp_component.md) defines the components whose keys a namespace maps, and its [`#[prefix(...)]`](cgp_component.md) attribute is what registers a component into a namespace under a path. [`delegate_components!`](delegate_components.md) is where a context joins a namespace (via its `namespace` header) and where individual overrides are written; [`delegate_and_check_components!`](delegate_and_check_components.md) does the same and additionally checks the entries written directly in the block, though its derivation does not cover the components inherited through the namespace, so verifying the full merged wiring is left to a standalone [`check_components!`](check_components.md). The namespace's `Delegate` entries are resolved through [`RedirectLookup`](../providers/redirect_lookup.md), and per-type defaults are commonly expressed through [`use_delegate`](../providers/use_delegate.md)-style dispatch and the `DefaultNamespace` / `DefaultImpls1` traits in `cgp-component`. The underlying per-key table machinery is [`DelegateComponent`](../traits/delegate_component.md), which `RedirectLookup` walks at resolution time.

## Known issues

A context that joins a namespace with `namespace N;` cannot also wire, directly on itself, a path that `N` already registers. The `namespace N;` header emits a blanket `impl<Key> DelegateComponent<Key> for Ctx where Key: N<Ctx>`, which already covers every path `N` resolves; a direct `@path: Provider` entry on the same context emits a second `DelegateComponent` impl for that path, and the compiler rejects the overlap with `E0119`. Overriding therefore works only on a path the namespace routes *to* but does not itself terminate: register the component's [`#[prefix]`](cgp_component.md) redirect in a base namespace the context inherits, and leave the leaf path unclaimed by the namespace so the context can supply it. A path the namespace registers with a `:` body entry or a `#[default_impl]` is not overridable on the context; change it in the namespace instead. The same restriction stops an inheriting namespace from redefining a key its parent binds. This is a whole-program coherence fact the macro cannot detect, so it is deferred to the compiler; its full anatomy is in the [namespace override conflict](../../errors/wiring/namespace-override-conflict.md) error class. A related overlap arises when a context emits *two* blanket forwardings — joining two namespaces, or a bare-key `for` loop (`for <Key, Value> in Table { Key: Value }`) alongside a `namespace` join, which is why a loop key must be embedded in a path (`@app.SomeComponent.Key: Value`) — the [overlapping namespace forwarding](../../errors/wiring/namespace-forwarding-conflict.md) error class.

Two further whole-program failures are deferred to the compiler the same way. If a component is routed into a joined namespace by a `#[prefix]` but no entry ever *binds* a provider at its path — no `#[default_impl]`, body entry, or direct wiring — the redirect lands on an empty table slot, and a `check_components!` reports the lookup as unsatisfied (`E0277`); this is the [unregistered namespace path](../../errors/checks/unregistered-namespace-path.md) error class. And a circular parent chain is rejected eagerly at the `cgp_namespace!` definitions, though the two shapes of cycle fail differently and only one of them overflows. A chain through two or more namespaces — `new A: B` with `new B: A` — makes the inheritance blanket impl's `where` clause loop, reported as `E0275` overflow at both definitions (`overflow evaluating the requirement '__Key__: A<__BComponents>'`, with a note naming the other). A **self-inheriting** namespace, `new A: A`, does not overflow: the forwarding impl it emits has a value parameter nothing can determine, so the compiler rejects it with `E0207` instead (`the type parameter '__Value__' is not constrained by the impl trait, self type, or predicates`). Both mean the parent chain is not acyclic; only the first says so recognizably. This is the [namespace inheritance cycle](../../errors/wiring/namespace-inheritance-cycle.md) error class.
