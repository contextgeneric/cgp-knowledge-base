# `TryComputer`

`TryComputer` and `TryComputerRef` are the fallible synchronous corner of the [handler family](../../concepts/handlers.md): components that transform an `Input` into an `Output` under a phantom `Code` tag, returning a `Result` against the context's abstract error type.

## Purpose

`TryComputer` exists for synchronous computations that can fail. A computation that parses a string, looks up a key, or checks an invariant may not be able to produce its output, and it needs a way to report the failure. `TryComputer` gives it one: instead of returning `Output` directly like [`Computer`](computer.md), its method returns `Result<Output, Error>`, where the error is the context's shared abstract error type. This places it one step up from `Computer` on the fallibility axis of the family — still synchronous, but now able to fail — and one step below [`Handler`](handler.md), which adds asynchrony on top of fallibility.

Returning the *context's* abstract error rather than a concrete one is what keeps a `TryComputer` provider generic. A provider does not commit to `anyhow::Error` or `std::io::Error`; it returns `Self::Error`, and the concrete error type is decided once, at wiring time, by whichever error backend the context plugs in. This is why both fallible computer components supertrait [`HasErrorType`](has_error_type.md): the supertrait is what gives the trait a `Self::Error` to name in its `Result`, and it is what ties every fallible component in a context to the same error type so their results compose.

## Definition

`TryComputer` is a CGP component defined with `#[cgp_component]`, and it imports the context's abstract error type through [`#[use_type(HasErrorType.Error)]`](../attributes/use_type.md) so that its method can return that error by the bare name `Error`:

```rust
#[cgp_component(TryComputer)]
#[prefix(@cgp.extra.handler in DefaultNamespace)]
#[derive_delegate(UseDelegate<Code>)]
#[derive_delegate(UseInputDelegate<Input>)]
#[use_type(HasErrorType.Error)]
pub trait CanTryCompute<Code, Input> {
    type Output;

    fn try_compute(
        &self,
        _code: PhantomData<Code>,
        input: Input,
    ) -> Result<Self::Output, Error>;
}
```

The consumer trait `CanTryCompute<Code, Input>` mirrors `CanCompute` but for the fallible case. Its `try_compute` method takes `&self`, a `PhantomData<Code>` naming the computation, and the `Input` by value, returning `Result<Self::Output, Error>` — the associated `Output` on success and the context's abstract error on failure. `#[use_type(HasErrorType.Error)]` adds `HasErrorType` as a supertrait and rewrites the bare `Error` to `<Self as HasErrorType>::Error`, so the definition writes neither `HasErrorType` nor `Self::Error` by hand; the local associated type `Output` stays qualified as `Self::Output`, since it is the trait's own type. The component is wired through the generated `TryComputerComponent` marker, and the macro generates the provider trait `TryComputer<Context, Code, Input>` with the context moved into an explicit first parameter. The two `#[derive_delegate(...)]` attributes generate dispatching providers keyed on `Code` and on `Input`, and `#[prefix(@cgp.extra.handler in DefaultNamespace)]` registers the component into that namespace path like the rest of the family.

The by-reference sibling `TryComputerRef` is identical except that it borrows its input. Its consumer trait `CanTryComputeRef` also imports the error type with `#[use_type(HasErrorType.Error)]` and declares `fn try_compute_ref(&self, _code: PhantomData<Code>, input: &Input) -> Result<Self::Output, Error>`, taking `&Input` where `CanTryCompute` takes `Input`. Both components are synchronous; their async-and-fallible counterpart is `Handler`.

## Implementations

A `TryComputer` provider is a zero-sized struct implementing the provider trait for a generic context that has an error type. Because the result names `Context::Error`, every fallible provider carries a `Context: HasErrorType` bound in its `where` clause. The crate's `ReturnInput` provider illustrates the minimal shape — it succeeds unconditionally, returning its input as the output:

```rust
impl<Context, Code, Input> TryComputer<Context, Code, Input> for ReturnInput
where
    Context: HasErrorType,
{
    type Output = Input;

    fn try_compute(
        _context: &Context,
        _code: PhantomData<Code>,
        input: Input,
    ) -> Result<Self::Output, Context::Error> {
        Ok(input)
    }
}
```

A `TryComputer` sits in the middle of the promotion lattice, so it both receives providers promoted from below and is promoted upward in turn. A plain [`Computer`](computer.md) becomes a `TryComputer` by wrapping its output in `Ok` — this is the `Promote` combinator — so an infallible provider satisfies `CanTryCompute` for free. In the other direction, a `Computer` whose output is *already* a `Result<Output, Context::Error>` becomes a `TryComputer` that unwraps that result, which is the `TryPromote` combinator; and a `TryComputer` is itself promoted to the async [`Handler`](handler.md) by wrapping it in a future. These promotions live in the [handler combinators](../providers/handler_combinators.md), so a provider author implements whichever single variant fits and lets the wiring bridge to `TryComputer`.

## Examples

A `TryComputer` provider that parses a string into a number, raising the context's error on failure, wires into a context like any other component:

```rust
use core::marker::PhantomData;
use cgp::prelude::*;
use cgp::extra::handler::{CanTryCompute, TryComputer, TryComputerComponent};

#[cgp_impl(new ParseU64)]
#[uses(CanRaiseError<core::num::ParseIntError>)]
#[use_type(HasErrorType.Error)]
impl<Code> TryComputer<Code, String> {
    type Output = u64;

    fn try_compute(
        &self,
        _code: PhantomData<Code>,
        input: String,
    ) -> Result<Self::Output, Error> {
        input.parse().map_err(|e| Self::raise_error(e))
    }
}

delegate_components! {
    App {
        TryComputerComponent: ParseU64,
    }
}
```

The provider `ParseU64` returns its `u64` output or the context's abstract error, converting the concrete `ParseIntError` into that error with `CanRaiseError`. Because the consumer trait supertraits `HasErrorType`, the context must have an error type wired before it can call `try_compute` — `App` would delegate its `ErrorTypeProviderComponent` (and an error raiser) as well as `TryComputerComponent`. In everyday use the [`#[cgp_computer]`](../macros/cgp_computer.md) macro generates this kind of provider from a function returning `Result<u64, String>`, and wires the promotion table so the same function also answers `CanCompute` (returning the `Result` as its output), `CanHandle`, and the `Ref` variants.

## Related constructs

`TryComputer` is the fallible synchronous corner of the [handler family](../../concepts/handlers.md); its infallible counterpart is [`Computer`](computer.md), and its async-and-fallible generalization is [`Handler`](handler.md). It supertraits [`HasErrorType`](has_error_type.md), which supplies the `Self::Error` it returns, and a fallible provider typically uses [`CanRaiseError`](can_raise_error.md) to convert a concrete source error into that abstract error. The combinators that promote a `Computer` into a `TryComputer` (`Promote`, `TryPromote`) and a `TryComputer` into a `Handler` are documented in [handler combinators](../providers/handler_combinators.md). The macro that builds a `TryComputer` provider from a fallible function is [`#[cgp_computer]`](../macros/cgp_computer.md), and dispatching on `Code` or `Input` uses [`UseDelegate`](../providers/use_delegate.md) and the family's `UseInputDelegate`, per [dispatching](../../concepts/dispatching.md).
